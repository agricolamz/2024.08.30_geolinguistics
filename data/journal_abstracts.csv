Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This study investigates mood choice for five Acadian French communities in Atlantic Canada which have intertwined settlement histories but which differ in terms of type and degree of dialect contact. The two communities with least contact with supralocal French preserve the highly salient imperfect subjunctive, moribund or absent from most other present-day spoken French varieties. While four communities exhibit high selection rates for the present subjunctive, in line with variationist analyses of other French varieties, one community has surprisingly low rates of such usage, along with absence of the imperfect subjunctive. This dichotomy is explained by the local prestige of the smaller of two founder groups for the community, settlers from Haute-Bretagne, France, a dialect area for which the historical record reveals low levels of subjunctive forms. The results highlight the importance not only of demographic factors but also of local identity construction in the formation of new contact varieties."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This article presents a new method for processing data gathered using the “draw-a-map” task in perceptual dialectology (PD) studies. Such tasks produce large numbers of maps containing many lines indicating nonlinguists’ perceptions of the location and extent of dialect areas. Although individual maps are interesting, and numerical data relating to the relative prominence of dialect areas can be extracted, an important value of the draw-a-map task is in aggregating data. This was always an aim of the contemporary PD method, although the nature of the data has meant that this has not always been possible. Here, we argue for the use of geographic information systems (GIS) in order to aggregate, process, and display PD data. Using case studies from the United Kingdom and Germany, we present examples of data processed using GIS and illustrate the future possibilities for the use of GIS in PD research."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper introduces the Personalized Implicit Association Test (P-IAT, Olson &amp; Fazio, 2004) as a novel measure for language attitudes. Tying in with sociolinguists’ renewed interest in social psychological attitude measures (e.g., Campbell-Kibler, 2012; Pantos &amp; Perkins, 2012; Speelman, Spruyt, Impe &amp; Geeraerts, 2013), the study uses the P-IAT to measure associations with regional varieties of Belgian Dutch and compares the results to an explicit measurement, as well as the results from an experiment using auditory affective priming, another reaction time based attitude measure developed in social psychology, reported in Speelman et al. (2013). Results from both implicit measures show a strong preference for the standard variety of Belgian Dutch over out-group regional varieties, as well as in-group preferences for participants’ own variety over other regional varieties. However, results do not entirely coincide. The paper concludes by discussing the benefits and potential demerits of the P-IAT as a measure of language attitudes."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Using data from a Swiss German dialect syntax survey, this study aims to explore, in a spatially differentiated manner, the correlation between dialectal variation and geographic distances. A linguistic distance was expressed by a measure aggregated from 60 survey questions. To operationalize the possibility of language contact, Euclidean distance, as well as travel times in 2000, 1950 and 1850 between survey sites were used. Going beyond previous work by others, we also explore the covariation of geographic and linguistic distances at the local level, focusing on spatial subsets and individual survey sites, thus being able to paint a more differentiated picture. With the diverse physical landscape of Switzerland making an impact on potential language contact, we find that travel times are a better predictor than Euclidean distance for the syntactic variation in Swiss German dialects. However, on the local scale the difference is not always significant, depending on prevalent topography."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"In the extreme northeastern Argentine province of Misiones, vernacular Portuguese is the primary language of many rural communities, in bilingual contact with Spanish. The present study examines data from Misiones Portuguese and Spanish for evidence of morphosyntactic convergence in the absence of formal schooling in either language or sociolinguistic pressures to produce canonical varieties. Data from a corpus of vernacular Misiones Portuguese and the results of a speeded translation task reveal that even in this sociolinguistically permissive environment bilingual speakers maintain distinct morphosyntactic systems for Portuguese and Spanish (exemplified by nominal plural marking and first-person plural verbal inflection). The data also suggest that bilingual contact alone does not yield the degree of convergence required for the hybrid Portuguese-Spanish morphosyntaxis that has been reported, for example, in northern Uruguay."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"The use of loanwords is generally attributed to a social feature, like social prestige, and to semantic features, like the need to fill a lexical gap. However, few studies take into account variation in the use of loanwords within a speech community, and directly compare the frequency of loanwords from more than one source language. This paper contributes to research on lexical borrowing by comparing the distribution of loanwords from three different source languages in two large databases of dialect data. We take an onomasiological perspective, which allows us to gauge the frequency of borrowed lexical items vis-à-vis alternative expressions. Using Generalized Additive Mixed Modeling, we show that the usage of loanwords can only be explained by taking into account the interaction between semantics and geographical diffusion. Our analysis confirms that the patterns that occur almost exclusively reflect changes in socio-cultural history."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper presents the results of a multivariate spatial analysis of thirty-eight vowel formant variables measured in 236 cities from across the contiguous United States, based on the acoustic data from the Atlas of North American English . The results of the analysis both confirm and challenge the results of the Atlas. Most notably, while the analysis identifies similar patterns as the Atlas in the West and the Southeast, the analysis finds that the Midwest and the Northeast are distinct dialect regions that are considerably stronger than the traditional Midland dialect region identified in the Atlas . The analysis also finds evidence that a vowel shift is actively shaping the language of the Western United States."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Perceptual dialectology investigates nonlinguists’ beliefs about their own and other varieties. This paper fills a gap in longitudinal research in this area with a restudy of the perceptions of Miami Cubans carried out twelve years after the first study. Perceptions are examined in relation to social and demographic changes with a sample of 84 participants of Cuban origin who responded to a questionnaire about the correctness of regional varieties of Spanish. The results showed that perceptions of non-Cuban varieties remained relatively stable over time, continuing to correlate with race and poverty. Perceptions toward the Cuban Spanish of the Miami community were also stable and, as in the earlier study, were highly positive, reflecting strong beliefs in its correctness-status. In contrast, perceptions of Cuban Spanish on the island were significantly more negative; it was ranked the least correct of the regional varieties evaluated. Factors underlying perceptions are examined in relation to demographic changes, political ideology, and beliefs about race and poverty. This paper highlights the contribution of the longitudinal study of dialect perceptions to the understanding of language attitudes, intergroup relations, and language change."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Work in sociolinguistic typology and creole studies has established the theory that intensive language contact involving second language acquisition by adults tends to lead to grammatical simplification. This theory is built on many anecdotal case studies, including developments in the history of Continental North Germanic associated with contact with Middle Low German. In this paper, we assess the theory by examining two changes in the history of Norwegian: the loss of coda /Cr/ clusters and the loss of prepositional genitives. If the theory is correct, these changes should have been innovated in centers of contact with Middle Low German. We find that both changes in fact spread into southeastern Norwegian from Swedish. Since contact with Low German also took place in Sweden and Denmark, this is consistent with the theory. It opens questions for future research about the role of dialect contact in simplificatory change in North Germanic."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"The current study used a hand-drawn map task, a dialect difference rating task, and a dialect classification task to explore the relationship between participants’ ideologies about dialect differences and their classification of authentic talkers from six regional varieties in Enshi Prefecture, China. The talkers frequently mistaken for each other in the dialect classification task were those who came from counties that were perceived to have similar dialects in the hand-drawn map task and the dialect difference rating task. Participants showed a positive response bias for the Enshi dialect in classifying talkers, corresponding to the dialect difference ratings that Enshi was rated as least different. Thus participants’ classification of real talkers was largely consistent with their ideologies about differences among “imagined” dialects. Participants’ ideologies about dialect differences were shaped by their home county, and their classification performance was affected by their home county and the talker’s social background."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"In this paper we provide a preliminary characterization of the phonemic trill (i.e., /r/) as produced by twenty-four speakers of northern and central Peninsular Spanish. The acoustic analysis revealed a considerable number of non-canonical variants containing one or zero apical occlusions. The quantitative results showed robust effects of the following three factors on trill articulation: Speaker dialect, gender, and preceding vowel. Regarding social factors, central Peninsular speakers and male speakers showed the greatest propensity to produce fewer occlusions per phonemic trill. Regarding linguistic factors, non-canonical variants were especially common in contexts of preceding /u/; we interpret this result on articulatory grounds given the antagonistic gestures required for the trill and the high back vowel. All in all, these findings offer empirical support that geographically-oriented studies within a sociophonetic framework offer critical information on the diachrony of trill consonants."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Dialectometric intensity estimation as introduced in Rumpf etal. (2009) and Pickl and Rumpf (2011, 2012) is a method for the unsupervised generation of maps visualizing geolinguistic data on the level of linguistic variables. It also extracts spatial information for subsequent statistical analysis. However, as intensity estimation involves geographically conditioned smoothing, this method can lead to undesirable results. Geolinguistically relevant structures such as rivers, political borders or enclaves, for instance, are not taken into account and thus their manifestations in the distributions of linguistic variants are blurred. A possible solution to this problem, as suggested and put to the test in this paper, is to use linguistic distances rather than geographical (Euclidean) distances in the estimation. This methodological adjustment leads to maps which render geolinguistic distributions more faithfully, especially in areas that are deemed critical for the interpretation of the resulting maps and for subsequent statistical analyses of the results."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Morphosyntactic dialect variation, once a neglected area of dialect research, has recently witnessed a large growth in interest. Various methods from geospatial data analysis have been applied to morphosyntactic data. To date, the focus has largely been on analyzing the distribution of stable patterns of variation. This article extends this work to examine patterns of ongoing change. It uses a body of data from the Syntactic Atlas of Welsh Dialects and the Siarad Corpus of spoken Welsh to examine the innovation and diffusion of a new second-person singular pronoun, chdi , testing the usefulness of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) as a method for identifying and modeling patterns of ongoing syntactic change. It is shown that GWR provides plausible models of the diachronic development of changes that are still in progress. Furthermore, it allows us to test whether rates of change are constant across geographical space, allowing us to test whether the Constant Rate Hypothesis (that diffusion of change proceeds at the same rate in different environments) holds between dialects."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This article presents computer supported “language production experiments” (LPEs) as a method for the investigation of syntactic variation. It describes the setup for the investigation of numerous syntactic phenomena and provides a sample study of the German GET passive across Austria. It also suggests that LPEs offer possibilities for the targeted investigation of linguistic variation in various ways. They may be used to explore speakers’ individual linguistic repertoires and an according corpus setup can be used to examine e.g., interspeaker patterns of variation. LPEs also enable researchers to investigate which linguistic factors control or influence syntactic variation."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"In this paper, ideas from perceptual dialectology, linguistics of speech, and cognitive science are drawn upon to explain the perceptions of others’ speech. The perceptual map task, based on Preston’s “Draw-a-map methodology,” was collected from 215 respondents in Poland and transformed into result maps. The second step in the analysis of the perceptual maps was to collect all of the labels that were assigned to the perceived speech varieties around the country. Those two facets of the data show how the idea of connecting speech with a specific locality can be observed quantitatively. The results propose an explanation of the distribution of speech perceptions in Poland. The shape of the perceptions is created through activating gestalt processes to arrive with an observational artifact. Those are based mostly on the concept of geography facilitated by shared cultural schemas. All of those steps lead to a creation of multidimensional perceptual regions."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"In this paper we introduce a computationally enriched experimental tool designed to investigate language ideology (change). In a free response experiment, 211 respondents returned three adjectives in reaction to the labels for five regional varieties, one ethnic variety and two supra-regional varieties of Belgian Dutch, as well as the standard accent of Netherlandic Dutch. Valence information (pertaining to the positive/negative character of the responses) and big data–based distributional analysis (to detect semantic similarity between the responses) were used to cluster the response adjectives into 11 positive and 11 negative evaluative dimensions. Correspondence analysis was subsequently used to compute and visualize the associations between these evaluative dimensions and the investigated language labels, in order to generate “perceptual maps” of the Belgian language repertoire. Contrary to our expectations, these maps unveiled not only the dominant value system which drives standard usage, but also the competing ideology which frames the increasingly occurring non-standard forms. In addition, they revealed a much richer stratification than the “one variety good, all other varieties bad” dichotomy we had anticipated: while VRT-Dutch remains the superior (albeit increasingly virtual) standard for Belgian Dutch, the stigmatized colloquial variety Tussentaal is gradually being accepted as a practical lingua franca, and the Ghent-accent is boosted by modern prestige (dynamism) features. Even more crucially, separate perceptual maps for the older and younger respondents lay bare generational change: there is a growing conceptual proximity between VRT-Dutch and Tussentaal in the younger perceptions."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Pluricentric approaches to international varieties have been a mainstay in English dialectology since the 1980s, often implied rather than expressed. What is standard lore in many philologies is today questioned in one philology, however. This paper assesses the pros and cons of the so-called “pluri-areal” perspective, which has in the past few years become prominent in German dialectology. Intended to replace the pluricentric model, “pluri-arealist” perspectives affect the modelling of German standard varieties in Austria and Switzerland, among others. Attempting to falsify claims on both sides, this paper argues from an English-German comparative perspective that the idiosyncratic treatment of national varieties in one context is a problem that threatens the unity of the field regarding how the standard is seen in relation to other varieties. It is shown that the base of the “pluri-areal” paradigm is an a-theoretical perspective of geographical variation that adheres implicitly to a One Standard German Axiom . This meta-theoretical paper suggests three principles to prevent such terminologically-fuelled confusion henceforth."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This perceptual-dialectology study investigates how listener-related social factors impact the geographical recognition of regional accents. In contrast to much prior research on English, our focus is on Dutch, which lends itself well to our study, allowing for notable regional accents within a well-defined standard language. Using a map-based recognition task in which 1,578 listeners placed forty representative speakers on a map based on fragments of their speech, we investigated the regional biases in accent recognition and the extent to which each listener’s awareness of these depends on their familiarity and proximity. Education, geographical knowledge, and distance to listeners’ own regions significantly predicted their accent-recognition accuracy. Moreover, we found a curvilinear age effect, which we interpret in terms of age-related changes in geographical and social mobility. We show how these effects in our design lead to meaningful accent-recognition patterns in groups of listeners."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper presents the results of the first investigation into Kurdish linguistic varieties and their spatial distribution. Kurdish dialects are used across five nation states in the Middle East and only one dialect, Sorani, has official status in one of these nation states. The study employs the “draw-a-map” task established in Perceptual Dialectology; the analysis is supported by Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The results show that, despite the geolinguistic and geopolitical situation, Kurdish respondents have good knowledge of the main varieties of their language (Kurmanji, Sorani, and the related variety Zazaki) and where to localize them. Awareness of the more diverse Southern Kurdish varieties is less definitive. This indicates that the Kurdish language plays a role in identity formation, but also that smaller isolated varieties are not only endangered in terms of speakers, but also in terms of their representations in Kurds’ mental maps of the linguistic landscape they live in."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper examines code choices in the written linguistic landscape of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). Due to a history of language imposition, the Marshall Islanders have long been denied the opportunity to express their linguistic identity in the public domain. A recently proposed bilingual language policy, which requires all public signs to be Marshallese-English bilingual, aims to change this status quo. We map language choices in the linguistic landscape of the RMI at the cusp of this policy with an eye on the stakeholders, production processes, and audiences involved in the creation and reception of the linguistic landscape. State-of-the-art geographical and regression analyses model the factors that govern code choices in the linguistic landscape of the RMI. Our findings allow us to pinpoint niches—both geographical as well as social—where the Marshallese assert their linguistic identity in the public realm."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Most recent studies on the geographical distribution of acoustic features analyze comparatively few speakers and localities, both of which may be unrepresentative of the diversity found in larger or more spatially fragmented populations. In the present study we introduce a new paradigm that enables the crowdsourcing of acoustic features through smartphone devices. We used Dialäkt Äpp , a free iOS app that allows users to record themselves, to crowdsource audio data. Nearly 3,000 speakers from 452 localities in German-speaking Switzerland provided recordings; we measured articulation rates for these speakers using a metric based on duration intervals between consecutive vowel onsets. Results revealed distinct regional differences in articulation rate between major dialect regions and individual localities. The specification of 452 localities enabled analyses at an unprecedented spatial resolution. Results further revealed a robust effect of gender, with women articulating significantly more slowly than men. Both the geographical patterns and the effect of gender found in this study corroborate similar findings on Swiss German previously reported in a very limited set of localities, thus verifying the validity of the crowdsourcing framework. Given the application of this new framework, a large bulk of the discussion is devoted to discussing methodological caveats."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This study uses a modified online version of the “draw-a-map” task and Garrett, Williams, and Evans’ (2005b) “keywords” methodology to explore the geospatial distribution of different accent and dialect labels and descriptors in Greater Manchester, UK. Specifically, we consider the distribution of the three most frequent labels related to “accentedness”: Broad , Strong , and Soft , as provided by 349 Greater Manchester residents. This analysis finds that these descriptors were clustered in separate areas of Greater Manchester, suggesting that they were being used to describe perceptually distinct varieties of English. In order to uncover the nuances in these folk-linguistic terms, we consider how they correlate with other concepts emerging from the dataset, finding that they are being used to differentiate between varieties with contrasting social associations. By combining innovative approaches, this study demonstrates how the subtleties of folk-linguistic modes of awareness can be uncovered through in-depth analysis of the terminology employed to describe linguistic variation on a very local scale. In so doing, it paves the way for further development of draw-a-map techniques that will enable similarly nuanced analysis in different regions, thus pushing the sub-discipline forward."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper provides a new classification of Central–Southern Italian dialects using dialectometric methods. All varieties considered are analyzed and cast in a data set where homogeneous areas are evaluated according to a selected list of phonetic features. Using numerical evaluation of these features and the Manhattan distance, a linguistic distance rule is defined. On this basis, the classification problem is formulated as a clustering problem, and a k-means algorithm is used. Additionally, an ad-hoc rule is set to identify transitional areas, and silhouette analysis is used to select the most appropriate number of clusters. While meaningful results are obtained for each number of clusters, a nine-group classification emerges as the most appropriate. As the results suggest, this classification is less subjective, more precise, and more comprehensive than traditional ones based on selected isoglosses."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"The present study offers an examination of attitudes and perceptions of the Ukrainian language by respondents who have lived at least half of their life in Ukraine; they were asked to draw on a map of Ukraine where the most correct Ukrainian is spoken and where the Ukrainian that grates on one’s ears is spoken. Recruitment for the online survey was conducted by placing ads on several Ukrainian-language Facebook pages, along with a link to the survey. The findings presented are from a total of 90 analyzed surveys. Respondents’ maps were analyzed and compared using QGIS software. The research demonstrates that that there is a tug-of-war of correctness between Kyiv and Lviv. It also shows that there is an overall tendency of native speakers to evaluate the Transcarpathian region as the area that grates one’s ears ."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"The aims of this paper are twofold. First, we locate the most effective human geographical methods for sampling across space in large-scale dialectological projects. We propose two geographical concepts as a basis for sampling decisions: Geo-demographic classification, which is a multidimensional method used for the socio-economic grouping of areas; we also develop an updated version of functional regions that can be used in sociolinguistic research. We then report on the results of a pilot project that applies these models to collect data regarding the acceptability of vernacular morphosyntactic forms in the North East of England. Following the method of natural breaks advocated for dialectology by Horvath &amp; Horvath (2002), we interpret breaks in the probabilistic patterns as areas of dialect transitions. This study contributes to the debate about the role and limitations of spatiality in linguistic analysis. It intends to broaden our knowledge about the interfaces between human geography and dialectology."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper uses dialect data to disentangle the contributions of phonology and morphology to the emergence of gender syncretism in the Dutch determiner paradigm. Quantitative and spatio-statistical analyses are used to identify an inverse relationship between phonological erosion and adoption of the innovative syncretic system, counter to expectation. That inverse relationship is shown to obscure the parallel development of the determiners in masculine and feminine contexts, leading to the suggestion that the syncretism results from a single morphological change triggered by phonological variability."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper addresses the question whether listeners possess sociolinguistic knowledge of regional variation in a sound change affecting /s/ + voiceless stop sequences in Andalusian Spanish. We tested whether speakers from Seville and Granada were perceived as more Sevillian-sounding and as younger when a stimulus contained the novel phonetic variant, a post-aspirated stop. Word-medial syllable-final /s/ was manipulated in such a way that two stimuli of the same speaker differed only in whether they contained pre-aspiration ([eh.ˈtaŋ.ko]) or post-aspiration ([e.ˈt h aŋ.ko]). Andalusian listeners rated the same speaker as younger and as more Sevillian-sounding when the stimulus contained a post-aspirated stop. The recognition of a speaker’s actual dialect was particularly high when the innovative variant was embedded in a Seville speaker’s speech, confirming earlier work that indexicality is context-specific. The results suggest that Andalusian listeners possess knowledge of the regional variation and the sound change and use this variation in social perception."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper examines the dialectology of eastern New York State. Data are considered from twelve cities and villages bridging the gap between the Inland North dialect region (home to the Northern Cities Shift [NCS]) and the Western New England region. Communities are classified as belonging to the Inland North “core,” the Inland North “fringe,” or a non–Inland North region. The settlement history of these communities is used to explain the boundaries between the dialect regions; presence of the NCS is found to correlate well with heavy migration from southwestern New England early in a community's history. Looking in detail at the different distributions of the individual sound changes involved in the NCS across the dialect regions established in this paper makes it possible to posit a reconstructed early history for the NCS and make hypotheses about the phonological character of the different sound changes."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"The complex series of vowel changes known as the Northern Cities Shift has been extensively documented over the last four decades across the broad territory of the Inland North dialect region. Little is known, however, about the origins of the shift, and there remain open questions about where the changes began and which vowel initiated the process. This paper examines such questions by analyzing the speech of several people born in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries using archival recordings of oral history interviews. Drawing on acoustic data we identify what appear to be early stages of the Northern Cities Shift in some individual speakers though many in the sample give no evidence of participating in the changes. We consider the implications of these findings for accounts of how the shift began with particular focus on Labov’s (2010) proposal."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Distinctive regional varieties of English have only recently emerged in parts of North America, including Wisconsin, where differences appear to be increasing today. We present an experiment in which listeners heard two short samples each from three Wisconsin regions and three other dialect areas. For each area, one sample was recorded pre-1970 and another recorded post-2010. Regional stereotypes were excluded. In a situation of new and still-emerging regional varieties, we expected listeners to be able to more accurately identify recent speech samples versus old samples from Wisconsin. Listeners proved better at recognizing speakers from Wisconsin in newer over older recordings. This complicates previous discussions of dialect awareness, in particular ‘enregisterment,’ with our listeners able to identify Wisconsin speech even in the absence of salient, known dialect features."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Geolectal variation is often present in settings where one language is spoken across a vast geographic area. This can be found in phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexical features. For practical reasons, it is not always possible to conduct fieldwork in every single location of interest in order to obtain the full pattern of variation, and a sample of them must be chosen. We propose and test a method for sampling these locations, with the goal of obtaining a distribution of typological features representative of the whole area. We apply k -means and hierarchical clustering algorithms for defining this sample, based on their geographic distribution. We test our methods against simulated data with several spatial configurations, and also against real data from Circassian dialects (Northwest Caucasian). Our results show an efficiency significantly higher than random sampling for detecting this variation, which makes our method profitable to fieldworkers when designing their research."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper presents a topic modeling approach to corpus-based dialectometry. Topic models are most often used in text mining to find latent structure in a collection of documents. They are based on the idea that frequently co-occurring words present the same underlying topic. In this study, topic models are used on interview transcriptions containing dialectal speech directly, without any annotations or preselected features. The transcriptions are modeled on complete words, on character n-grams, and after automatical segmentation. Data from three languages, Finnish, Norwegian, and Swiss German, are scrutinized. The proposed method is capable of discovering clear dialectal differences in all three datasets, while reflecting the differences between them. The method provides a significant simplification of the dialectometric workflow, simultaneously saving time and increasing objectivity. Using the method on non-normalized data could also benefit text mining, which is the traditional field of topic modeling."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This study explores perceptions held by speakers of Qassimi Arabic (a variety of Najdi Arabic, spoken in central Saudi Arabia) about linguistic variation in their own dialect, and the sociocultural evaluations associated with their perceptions. Drawing on perceptual dialectology research methods, respondents completed the draw-a-map and labeling tasks. The maps were collected and then analyzed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping software to aggregate, query, and create a composite heat map. Findings indicate that Qassimi speakers perceive regional variation to be associated with urban centers, particularly Buraydah and Unayzah, which were identified as the most salient dialect areas. Analysis of the labeled maps generated six categories of evaluative comments: drawl, influences from other regional dialects, heavy accent, old vocabulary, fast, and affrication. These findings point to the need for further exploration of the underlying ideologies and social values that Arabic speakers have about their own dialects and other dialects in Arabic-speaking communities."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This Perceptual Dialectology (PD) study asked residents of Cardiff, Wales, about their perceptions of English in the United Kingdom (UK). In addition, because face to face exposure to dialect variation has rarely been included as a variable in PD studies, participants were asked about their travel experience to ascertain whether this might influence their responses to a PD map task. Participants’ responses to the map task were analyzed using ArcGIS to create composite maps. Results show that these Cardiffians perceive “dialect or regional” speech boundaries to be located around major cities in England and Wales but also southwest Wales. Composite maps and polygon counts suggest that the more traveled respondents have a more nuanced perception of dialect regions than those who claim to travel less, suggesting that travel experience may influence PD participants’ responses to map tasks."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This study examines the social perceptions of the traditional Andalusian feature [ʃ] and the Castilian feature [tʃ] in the city of Huelva and the town of Lepe in Western Andalucía, Spain. A matched-guise experiment was created by digitally manipulating spontaneous speech from twelve Western Andalusian speakers, varying only in word-medial syllable-initial [tʃ] and [ʃ] for &lt;ch&gt; in disyllabic words. Based on 221 listeners from Huelva and Lepe, mixed effects linear regression models indicate that listeners evaluated speakers with [tʃ] guises as being of higher status, more cosmopolitan, and less friendly than speakers with [ʃ] guises. These findings interacted with speaker and listener gender, listener educational level, and listener origin. The implications are twofold: the traditional Andalusian feature is evaluated as less overtly prestigious than the supra-local Castilian feature; and, that two nearby communities of the same dialect variety may share similar language attitudes, but demonstrate nuanced differences in attitudes due to their unique historical and socioeconomic developments."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"In the early 2000s, the SADS, an extensive linguistic atlas project, surveyed more than three thousand individuals across German-speaking Switzerland on over two hundred linguistic variants, capturing the morphosyntactic variation in Swiss German. In this paper, we applied TESS, a Bayesian clustering method from evolutionary biology to the SADS to infer population structure, building on parallels between biology and linguistics that have recently been illustrated theoretically and explored experimentally. We tested three clustering models with different spatial assumptions: a nonspatial model, a spatial trend model with a spatial gradient, and a spatial full-trend model with both a spatial gradient and spatial-autocorrelation. Results reveal five distinct morphosyntactic populations, four of which correspond to traditional Swiss German dialect regions and one of which corresponds to a base population. Moreover, the spatial trend model outperforms the nonspatial model, suggesting a gradual transition of morphosyntax and supporting the idea of a Swiss German dialect continuum ."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper presents the results of a survey of phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic variation in British English, based on over 14,000 responses. We map twelve variables using geospatial “hotspot” analysis. One of our aims is to document the patterning of under- and unstudied variables. A second aim is to track changes in real time, which we do by comparing our findings to those of the 1950s-era Survey of English Dialects (SED; Orton, 1962). We improve upon previous dialectological work by paying careful attention to the phonemic status of mergers and splits: In our contemporary data, we do this by asking subjects if they have a phonemic contrast; in the SED data, we do this by superimposing the isoglosses for individual phones. We find evidence for both stability and change; we document previously unverified patterns. Perhaps most importantly, we identify a number of directions for future research."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"In this paper we deal with the spatial distribution of 16 linguistic features known to vary between Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian. We perform our analyses on a dataset of geo-encoded Twitter status messages collected in the period from mid-2013 to the end of 2016. We perform two types of analyses. The first one finds boundaries in the spatial distribution of the linguistic variable levels through the kernel density estimation smoothing technique. These boundaries are then plotted over the state borders for a visual comparison. The second analysis deals with linguistic distance between the states. The groupings of linguistic variables and countries are calculated given the state borders and the Jensen-Shannon divergence between distributions of the 16 variables within each state. This analysis is completed with a measure of variable consistency for each country. These analyses are intended to show the extent to which current state borders correspond to linguistic boundaries. They suggest that Croatia and Serbia still represent the two extremes, reflecting a history of normative divergences, while Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro, depending on the variable, lean to one or the other side."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper describes the independent construction and implementation of two cellular automata that model dialect feature diffusion as the adaptive aspect of the complex system of speech. We show how a feature, once established, can spread across an area, and how the distribution of a dialect feature as it stands in Linguistic Atlas data could either spread or diminish. Cellular automata use update rules to determine the status of a feature at a given location with respect to the status of its neighboring locations. In each iteration all locations in a matrix are evaluated, and then the new status for each one is displayed all at once. Throughout hundreds of iterations, we can watch regional distributional patterns emerge as a consequence of these simple update rules. We validate patterns with respect to the linguistic distributions known to occur in the Linguistic Atlas Project."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This study aims at testing whether there are regional differences in the perception of the labiodental fricative contrast in Dutch. Previous production studies have shown that the devoicing of initial labiodental fricatives is a change in progress in the Dutch language area. We present the results of a speeded identification task in which fricative stimuli were systematically varied for two phonetic cues, voicing and duration. Listeners (n=100) were regionally stratified, and the regions (k=5) reflect different stages of this sound change in progress. Voicing turned out to be the strongest categorization cue in all regions; duration only played a minor role. Regional differences showed up in the perception of the consonantal contrast that matched regional differences in production reported in previous studies. The addition of random slopes in the mixed model regression showed the importance of within-regional variation."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Contrary to previous “sociolinguistic folklore” that African American (Vernacular) English has a uniform structure across different parts of the US, recent studies have shown that it varies regionally, especially phonologically (Wolfram, 2007; Thomas &amp; Wassink, 2010). However, there is little research on how Americans perceive AAE variation. Based on a map-labeling task, we investigate the folk perception of AAE variation by 55 participants, primarily African Americans in Columbus, Ohio. The analysis focuses on the dialect regions recognized by the participants, the linguistic features associated with different regions, and the attitudes associated with these beliefs. While the perceived regional boundaries mostly align with those identified by speakers in previous perceptual dialectology studies on American English, the participants consistently identified linguistic features that were specific to AAE. The participants recognized substantial phonological and lexical variation and identified “proper” dialects that do not necessarily sound “white”. This study demonstrates the value of considering African Americans’ perspectives in describing African American varieties of English."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper investigates whether European Francophone subjects are able to distinguish between regional French accents from (northern) France, Belgium, and Switzerland, and at what level of granularity. In total, samples from 120 speakers (from five different areas in each country under study) were presented to hundreds of native French listeners from these three countries. In a first set of experiments, listeners were asked to identify the speakers’ country of origin: they achieved 60% correct identification on average, with significant effects of listeners’ region of origin, speakers’ age, socioeconomic status, and region of origin. In a second set of experiments, listeners from Belgium, France, and Switzerland were asked to identify the speakers’ region of origin within each country (5-alternative forced choice). Results, albeit above chance, proved to be poorer than they were in the first set of experiments (31% correct identification on average). Complementary analyses were conducted to evaluate the role of listeners’ region of origin, speakers’ age, speakers’ region of origin, and their interaction. They showed asymmetrical response patterns across the three countries under investigation: France (or, within France, Paris, which represents the norm) seems to act as a magnet and a catalyst of unification. Younger generations, especially, are more often associated with its way of speaking when their accent is not clearly identifiable. Switzerland, though, resists this homogenizing process better than Belgium does."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"The distances between urban and suburban spaces, while small in Euclidean terms, have a rather large social reality. This paper calls attention to two reasons for this—suburban development and metropolitan fragmentation—and situates these phenomena within the context of sociological and historical thought about metropolitan areas. I test their role in linguistic variation through a case study of three Northern Cities Shift features (raised trap , fronted lot , and lowered thought ) in English of the St. Louis metropolitan area. I show that these features diffused throughout the region in three different ways. Additionally, phonological conditioning of lot -fronting differs between urban and suburban speakers, and retreat from urban dialect features is led in the suburbs. These findings highlight the need to consider the geography of metropolitan areas more deeply in studies of language variation and change in metropolitan areas, as similarity across a metropolitan area should not be assumed a priori ."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This article describes the influence of various basemaps in Perceptual Dialectology, on the national and state levels. The 180 perceptual maps of the United States and Tennessee were divided into six types of basemaps; tabulated results show that basemaps play a different role on the national and state level. On the national level, basemaps that have features reminiscent of boundaries (state lines or interstates) bias the respondents’ answers. On the state level, on the other hand, the map features do not seem to influence the results in any discernible way: at times the informants seemingly go against the details present on the basemap. This striking difference indicates that, though the respondents rely on basemap details at the national level, where they may not have enough experience with the whole country, they don’t pay much attention to the state-level basemap details as they follow their own more detailed ideas about perceptions."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"We recorded older male speakers and younger female speakers of 86 local dialects of Dutch. Using these data, we analyze and visualize the influence of standard Dutch on apparent time changes in these dialects. Focusing for the most part on variation in the sound components, we test whether (I) dialect change is mainly the result of convergence to standard Dutch, (II) sound changes in two dialects which make them converge to standard Dutch also make them more similar, and (III) sound changes in two dialects which make them diverge from standard Dutch also make them less similar. We used three-dimensional (first hypothesis) and five-dimensional Levenshtein distance implementations (second and third hypothesis). These implementations are a novel step in dialectometry and in the study of ongoing processes of language change and their consequences for the dialect landscape. The findings corroborate all three hypotheses."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper revisits the question of national varieties in German, a concept that still has not found solid empirical proof, at least not from a quantitative-etic perspective. The question raised is how data collected in the course of the international research project, Variantengrammatik des Standarddeutschen (Handbook of Grammatical Variation in Standard German), and the application of spatial statistical methods to geographical variant distribution patterns can contribute to this discussion. With the aid of Factor Analysis and spatially modified clustering of variant distribution patterns it is shown that—at least from a quantitative/corpus linguistic point of view—there is no evidence for assuming nation-specific varieties. Importantly, this result does not imply the existence of a homogenous German standard language; rather, it is argued that geographical variation does not self-evidently legitimize the assumption of standard varieties."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Since April 2015 is the sesquicentennial of the end of the Civil War, now is a particularly appropriate time to review the progress of the Corpus of American Civil War Letters (CACWL) project and to suggest directions it might go in the future. Since 2007, we have located and collected images of nearly 11,000 letters and transcribed over 9,000 of these, totaling well over four million words. Of the transcribed letters, just over 6,000 were written by southerners (490 individual letter writers), a corpus extensive enough to begin identifying and describing what features were distinctively Southern in 19th-century American English. We have already mapped many of these features that are especially common in southern letters, for example, fixing to , howdy , past tense/past participle hope ‘helped’, qualifier tolerable , intensifier mighty , pronoun hit , and the noun heap . By way of comparison, we also have a somewhat smaller but rapidly growing collection of 3,000 transcribed letters written by individuals from northern states, and variant features from these letters are also being mapped. The work at present is very preliminary; there are thousands of additional letters to be collected and transcribed, particularly from northern states and from states west of the Mississippi. However, by mapping variants from letters that have already been transcribed, we can begin to get a better understanding of regional differences, as well as how regional features spread westward in the decades before the Civil War. We can also begin to obtain some sense of how American English in general, and particularly its regional dialects, may have changed since the mid 19th century. This article presents a preview of a number of those findings."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"The present study explores how two symbolic boundaries—linguistic variety and race—intersect, influencing how Latin American immigrants are perceived in Spain. To this end, 217 Spaniards participated in an experiment in which they evaluated three men along a series of social properties, but they were presented with different combinations of linguistic variety (Argentinian, Colombian, or Spanish) and race (a White or Mestizo photograph). The results of mixed-effects regression models found that linguistic variety conditioned participants’ evaluations of status, occupational prestige, solidarity, and trustworthiness, and both variety and race conditioned evaluations of religiousness. We contend that linguistic features become associated with a specific group of people through rhematization (Gal, 2005; Irvine &amp; Gal, 2000) and, by extension, ideologies link those people with stereotypical characteristics. We conclude that the “ideological twinning” (Rosa &amp; Flores, 2017) of race and linguistic variety can enhance stereotypes toward immigrants and impact their experiences in the receiving country."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Sociodemographic information, such as a speaker’s regional origin, is intimately related to the judgments and social evaluations that listeners assign to that speaker. This association between linguistic form and social information can also lead to linguistic profiling, a harmful form of discrimination. The present study examines the geographic classifications and social attitudes attributed to ten phonetic variants used within regional varieties of Iberian (i.e., European) Spanish. We are specifically interested in understanding listeners’ geographical classifications and language attitudes held toward Andalusian Spanish, which is a less privileged regional variety spoken in Spain’s southern region, as compared to north-central Peninsular Spanish (NCPS). The results of an online survey show that 165 listeners were fairly consistent when geographically classifying Andalusian-sounding stimuli as originating from the south of Spain. Importantly, the respondents also attributed less favorable social meaning to the Andalusian-sounding stimuli in comparison to the NCPS-sounding stimuli. We link the findings to broader themes in sociolinguistics, such as language-based discrimination, linguistic insecurity, and the social motivations of language change."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"The use of both production and perceptual data has the potential to provide a more complete picture of linguistic phenomena than would otherwise be the case, including when exploring regional linguistic variation. Utilizing the social networking platform Twitter and an online survey, this paper reports on a descriptive analysis of the geographic distribution of a less-commonly used syntactic form of the Spanish verb gustar ‘to like, to please’, referred to as experiential gustar (e.g., cuando gustes ‘when you’d like’). The results from the analysis of 6,686 tweets together with the responses of 81 native Spanish-speaking participants in an online survey suggest that experiential gustar is produced and is perceived to be produced most often in Mexican Spanish, despite not being exclusive to that country. The paper contributes to the literature depicting the benefit of using both production and perceptual data in the study of dialectal variation, as well as to the literature documenting language variation in Spanish."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This article extends previous analyses on (ay) and (aw) raising in Yami, an endangered Austronesian language spoken on Orchid Island, Taiwan. Two patterns of (ay) and (aw) variation co-exist in Yami—the more conservative/unraised variants and the innovative/raised forms—each of which indexes an authentic regional identity. Results from recent data suggest that Yami has undergone significant changes in just one generation as the raised variants are now preferred by younger islanders and have started permeating through non-raising areas. Traumatic shifts in the ecological context on Orchid Island help explain this sound change. Economically, rapid shift from fishing/farming to tourism trades promotes daily face-to-face communications among younger islanders, which has catalyzed the spread of nucleus raising to non-raising areas. Sociopsychologically, ongoing intergroup conflicts between islanders and mainland Taiwanese may further trigger the sound change, altering nucleus raising into a new communal system which highlights Yami identity in opposition to Others."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Finding the boundaries of linguistic variants and studying transitions between variants are key interests in classical linguistic geography. However, the definition of boundaries in areal linguistics is vague, and a quantitative characterization of transitions at the interface between dialectal variants is missing. We conceptualize these transitions as gradients, aiming to quantitatively account for the transition patterns which are traditionally only implicitly inferred from visualizations. Fitting of logistic functions in different spatial scopes (profiles as well as surfaces) is proposed as an approach to model the transition at the interface between the dominant usage areas of dialectal variants. Logistic functions can accommodate the breadth of boundary concepts, ranging from sharp isoglosses to transitions with different gradualities. The parameters of the fitted logistic models as well as supplementary measures then allow for the quantitative characterization and comparison of transitions across variables. To demonstrate the proposed methodology, we use Swiss German syntactic data on dialectal variables with a single transition zone."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This article explores two fundamental dimensions in sociolinguistics: the dynamics of linguistic variation and change in international languages and the exploitation of data proceeding from significant countries. These issues will be addressed through examination of a particular syntactic feature and a possible change in progress: the occurrence of null direct objects in Spanish. It is shown that for Spanish, a widely used international language, social factors have not been decisive in explaining the distribution of the phenomenon under investigation. This study shows that while direct object omission is not conditioned by typical social variables such as sex, age, and gender, it is unevenly spread throughout the Spanish-speaking world: Mexico and the continental Caribbean use it more than other countries, such as Spain or Chile. Besides the relevance of geography, some semantic, discourse, and contextual factors are shown as determinant for the direct object omission. Finally, this paper reflects on methodology, specifically the use of a macroregional sociolinguistic method for data analysis as well as the advantages and shortcomings of a specific data collection technique that capitalizes on technological tools with global reach: the internet survey in an international scenario."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"We study regional similarities and differences in language use on an anonymous mobile chat application in the German-speaking area. We use a neural network on 2.3 million online conversations to automatically learn representations of words and cities. These linguistic-use-based representations capture regional distinctions in a high-dimensional vector space that can be clustered and visualized to discover patterns in the data. We find that the resulting regional patterns are closely linked to the traditional division of German dialects, even though most of the conversations are written in standard German. The resulting maps correspond to traditional dialect divisions and language-external spatial structures, with a few notable exceptions that can be explained through external factors. Our method also facilitates two qualitative analyses, allowing us to discover geographically-pertinent words for various regional levels, as well as creating regional group-specific style profiles based on various linguistic resources. The results of our study strongly suggest the existence of region-specific patterns of language use (“digital regiolects”) representing distinctive strategies of linguistic stylization in relation to linguistic resources and topics. As a methodological contribution, we show how linguistic theory can drive the application and direction of neural network-based representation learning, and how their judicious application provides the basis for qualitative analysis of large-scale data collections."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This article is an analysis of linguistic survey data representing German dialects in Switzerland in 1933/34 based on the so-called Wenker sentences. The data are impressionistic in terms of applied phonetic transcriptions, which were produced by non-specialists using the Latin alphabet. Due to the lack of pre-defined standardization, the phonetic transcriptions are very heterogeneous. From a technical perspective, this leads to very noisy data, which is why the validity of the Wenker data in general and the Swiss Wenker data in particular has been questioned. Using methods from computational linguistics, we compare, for the first time, Wenker data with linguistic data collected at virtually the same time by linguistics professionals. Direct comparison with a sample from the published atlas of German-speaking Switzerland (SDS) reveals that despite the noisiness of the data, they nevertheless provide reliable information, e.g., in terms of the spatial structuring of Swiss dialects. The study is thus a successful pilot for other corpus-based studies dealing with unstructured Wenker data in other regions."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Using a novel, digitized method, this paper investigates the language attitudes of 18- to 33-year-olds in South East England. More broadly, this paper demonstrates that disambiguating the language attitudes held towards sociodemographic groups and geographic areas is paramount to understanding the configuration of language attitudes in an area, particularly for areas with high cultural and linguistic heterogeneity. A total of 194 respondents evaluated the speech of 102 other south-eastern speakers. Results reveal an imperfect mapping between language attitudes held towards geographic areas and speakers from these areas. Although East London and Essex are the most negatively evaluated areas, speakers’ demographic and identity data is the primary factor conditioning language attitudes. Across South East England, working-class and/or ethnic minority speakers, as well as those who identify their accent in geographically marked terms, are evaluated most negatively, which is compounded if they are from East London or Essex."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper explores the cultural and historical forces that created variation in terms for “cemetery”, including links between language and material culture, using cemetery terms found within two Linguistic Atlas data sets to demonstrate how colonial influence, cultural changes, and physical locations contribute to linguistic variation. Speakers’ lexical choices in the 1930s still show the effects of the religious and social climates of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Northern and southern colonial trends were still influencing regional language use several hundred years later. Furthermore, for the LANE data we find that the physical location of historic cemeteries has an effect on speakers’ use of specific lexical items."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Researchers in dialectometry have begun to explore measurements based on fundamentally quantitative metrics, often sourced from dialect corpora, as an alternative to the traditional signals derived from dialect atlases. This change of data type amplifies an existing issue in the classical paradigm, namely that locations may vary in coverage and that this affects the distance measurements: pairs involving a location with lower coverage suffer from greater noise and therefore imprecision. We propose a method for increasing robustness using generalized additive modeling, a statistical technique that allows leveraging the spatial arrangement of the data. The technique is applied to data from the British English dialect corpus FRED; the results are evaluated regarding their interpretability and according to several quantitative metrics. We conclude that data availability is an influential covariate in corpus-based dialectometry and beyond, and recommend that researchers be aware of this issue and of methods to alleviate it."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This contribution focuses on the use of geben ‘give’ as a put verb in Upper German dialects in Austria from a historical and a recent perspective. On the basis of comprehensive historical and contemporary data from German varieties and Slavic languages our analyses provide evidence for the central hypothesis that this phenomenon traces back to language contact with Czech as already suggested by various scholars in the 19th century. This assumption is also supported by the fact that Czech dát ‘give’ in put function has been accounted for since the Old Czech period as well as by its high frequency in both formal and informal Czech written texts. Moreover, our data analyses show that geben ‘give’ as a put verb has been and is still areally distributed along and spreading from the contact area of Czech and Upper German varieties."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This study presents the first US-wide survey of the pin-pen merger since Labov, Ash &amp; Boberg (2006). Production and perception data were collected from 277 speakers from across the country, with perception-only data from an additional 94 speakers; these data largely replicated previous findings about the social and geographic distribution of the merger. An examination of production and perception data together showed that near merger—in which speakers cannot hear the difference between pin and pen words, yet pronounce them differently—was relatively common, although this phenomenon has received little attention in the literature on the merger. Additionally, an investigation of how merged speakers phonetically realized their merged pin-pen vowel revealed that, in contrast to previous findings, speakers were equally as likely to merge to [ɛ] ( tw[ɛ]n for twin ) as they were to [ i ] ( h[ i ]n for hen ). However, there was no apparent social or geographic patterning to this phonetic realization."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"The use of future subjunctive (FS) has suffered a steady decline in written Spanish from the fourteenth century. It is not clear whether it disappeared similarly in each clause, and whether its use was determined by regional distinctions to be considered as a dialectal feature. Granda (1986) suggested that the Hispanic Caribbean countries in the Americas were more conservative in the use of FS in contrast to other regions in a southerly direction. Ramírez-Luengo (2008), however, argued that FS decline occurred uniformly in the Americas, with the eighteenth century being the critical time for the substitution. In a sample of 45 legal documents (60,852 words) from the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, issued in northwest and southwest Colombia, the proportions of FS and other alternating forms were equally likely in both regions. FS tabulations were less likely to occur in the nineteenth century within relative clauses, while they were equally likely to occur in conditional protases. This suggests that FS in written Spanish does not show dialectal differences and that its decline might have occurred earlier in relative clauses than conditional protases, probably due to a stylistic motivation."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper investigates the occurrence of inflected predicative adjectives, an optional yet distinguishing feature of German dialects spoken in southern Switzerland. We provide an in-depth analysis of the patterns of change of this morphosyntactic marker with a particular focus on extralinguistic factors. Historical records from 1950 were compared to contemporary data collected from 192 speakers across 49 localities in 2020–21. Our results corroborate previous reports indicating a substantial, real-time decline in inflected forms. Logistic mixed-effects modeling suggests that the inflection of predicative adjectives occurs more frequently among speakers who report tight social networks, have a strong local dialect identity, and regularly use one or more Romance languages. These findings support the claim that tight social networks and local dialect identity construction may lead to the preservation of conservative grammatical forms. Additionally, the effect of Romance languages highlights the role of transfer phenomena induced by language contact."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This article provides a comparative overview of phonological and phonetic differences of Mukrī Kurdish varieties and their geographical distribution. Based on the examined data, four distinct varieties can be distinguished. In each variety area, different phonological patterns are analyzed according to age, gender, and social groups in order to establish cross-regional and cross-generational developments in relation to specific phonological distributions and shifts. The variety regions which are examined in the present article include West Mukrī (representing an archaic form of Mukrī), Central Mukrī (representing a linguistically peripheral dialect), East Mukrī (representing mixed archaic and peripheral dialect features), and South Mukrī (sharing features of both Mukrī and Ardałānī). The study concludes that variation in the Mukrīyān region depends on phonological developments, which in turn are due to geographical and sociological factors. Moreover, contact-induced change and internal language development are also established as triggering factors distinguishing regional variants."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper studies the perception of regional variation in Russian among young Russian nonlinguists in Moscow, Perm, and Novosibirsk. I explore the labels used in 55 perceptual maps and categorize them in order to investigate the perceived character of regional variation among young Russians, including their explanations for regional variation. The data analysis shows that claims about regional variation are based on the informants’ assessments of variation in Russian, but also on assessments of domains that they perceive as related to regional variation: style and accent, as well as extralinguistic features such as geography and climate. Based on this analysis, I argue that the line between regional language variation and other variations can be conceived of as fuzzy."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"By means of the first comprehensive apparent-time study of Austria’s traditional dialects, this paper explores the use of adnominal syntactic constructions of expressing the semantic relation of possession. The article focuses on both the geographical variation and the interplay of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. The analyses are based on data from direct recordings of 162 speakers from forty villages and on written questionnaire data from 103 of these speakers from thirty-seven villages. The analyses reveal clear geographical patterns for those constructions in which the possessor phrase precedes the possessum phrase within the entire construction. We propose to focus on the discursive-pragmatic properties of the possessor phrase to explain the fact that each of the observed dialects allows the possessor to precede the possessum. We provide evidence that referential anchoring, combined with the concept of accessibility, is the key to explaining the syntactic order within the used constructions."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper examines the variable weakening and deletion of /s/ in the Languedocian variety of Modern Occitan, with particular attention to how it has affected the system of plural marking in noun phrases. Using data from linguistic atlases, I demonstrate that /s/-lenition in this variety involves a stage of vocalization to [j]. I find that, where /s/ on the definite article has vocalized to [j], the immediately-preceding vowel of the definite article has undergone concomitant raising to [e]. This raising appears to preserve the difference between singular and plural despite the plural’s weakening /s/. I argue that these results support Labov’s (1994) hypothesis that the meaning of a weakening element may be transferred to a stable, co-occurrent one."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper demonstrates how the tools of dialect geography may fruitfully lend a new perspective to historical data in order to address the lingering questions left by previous analyses. A geographic examination of Survey of English Dialects data provides evidence in favor of a push-chain analysis of the Great Vowel Shift, in which the Middle English high-mid long vowels raised before the high long vowels were diphthongized. It is also demonstrated that the so-called “irregular” dialect outcomes, which have previously been cited as evidence for a lack of unity of the Great Vowel Shift, are no longer problematic when viewed in the light of a theory of dialect contact, and can in fact refine our understanding of the chronology and geographic extent of the shift itself."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper provides an account of the long vowel shift currently underway in the trans-statal Plautdietsch speech community. Placement of the shift within Labov’s typology of vowel shifts reveals a commonly overlooked development in Plautdietsch vowel movement, namely the centralization of mid-high back vowels which must have occurred before the breakup of the community into New and Old World groups. Shared centralization prompted both groups to have similar developments in the back vowel space after they were no longer geographically contiguous and prompted many groups to undergo centralization in the front vowel space. This case study reveals a pattern of innovation in which separation from parent communities fosters linguistic innovations in daughter communities. These innovations occur irrespective of the traditional Molotschna or Chortitza dialect affiliation of the daughter colonies in question."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Placenames are seemingly universal, with the potential to reveal different systems of organizing information in everyday communication. We report on the relationship between placenames in Jahai, an indigenous language spoken by the Jahai people of the Malay Peninsula, and the environment. Our approach explores the tendency to organize names using a hierarchy of kinship associated with the cnεl, mythological entities in origin stories, which appears to map onto catchment areas. By associating linguistic data with these ethnographic inputs and geographical properties calculated in a Geographic Information System, we generate and make suggestions for productive ways of understanding placenames as systems."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This study investigates the effect of differing representations of state boundaries on the draw-a-map task in perceptual dialectology in a region of the United States. The typical draw-a-map survey instrument represents state borders with solid lines. Would respondents react differently to maps with dashed-line state borders? More specifically, would respondents draw more dialect areas that cross state lines on maps with dashed-line state borders versus solid-line state borders? These questions are explored through two datasets, and similarities and differences emerge. For example, respondents of both map types draw more single-state dialect areas than multistate dialect areas, and respondents with dashed-line maps draw more dialect areas on average than respondents with solid state maps. While dataset 1 showed a significant association between map type and multistate dialect area with respondents using dashed-line border maps drawing more multistate dialect areas than respondents with solid-line maps, H (1) = 5.13, P = .017, this association was not significant in dataset 2, H (1) = .06, P = .798."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Describing specific dialect areas in terms of their lexis is an attractive idea now that the latest version of the English Dialect Dictionary Online ( EDD Online 3.0 , 2019) allows for quick and easy lexical retrievals of English dialect words of the Late Modern English period. This paper uses the Isle of Wight (I.W.) as a test case for putting such an idea into practice. The 137 words uniquely attributed in the EDD to I.W. are analyzed and interpreted in relation to the 1500-odd words used on I.W. alongside other areas of the UK. The paper informs the reader of the available query modes and discusses their pros and cons, quantifying and mapping the different numbers of isolated words in use on I.W. versus those unique to other English counties. The larger number of words that the island shared with the counties of the “mainland” will likewise be considered, thus allowing for first steps towards a “dialectometrical” analysis. The findings are related to the historical background of I.W., particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper aims to understand the contribution of geographical information in the perception of linguistic variation. A total of 813 mental maps collected among young speakers from different cities in Tuscany have been analyzed via an open-access web dialectometric tool (Gabmap). In particular, the study seeks to verify the role of geographic distance and the place of residence of the respondents in modeling perceived variation. The relationship between dialect grouping as made by linguists and perceived taxonomies of sublinguistic areas is also investigated. Results show that geographical proximity between mapped areas significantly predicts the perception of dialect similarity. Our participants made their decisions looking at (1) a keen sense of spatial contiguity, and (2) the synchronic presence of linguistic differences between the Tuscan subregions. Moreover, classification uncertainty grows when the mapped areas are very close to, or very distant from, the participants’ places of residence. Methodological and linguistic perspectives of mental maps in folk linguistics are finally discussed."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"The current study explored the relationship between participants’ label-based evaluations of six regional varieties in Enshi Prefecture, China, and their speech-based evaluations of talkers from these varieties using a label ranking task and a speaker evaluation task. The results revealed that under correct identification of talker dialect, participants’ evaluations of real talkers based on speech samples were different from their evaluations of ‘imagined’ county-based dialects, suggesting that speech-based talker evaluations are not solely governed by ideological values associated with dialects. Focusing on a small, understudied community in China, this study contributes to our understanding of the local language attitudes, and language use and maintenance in Enshi Prefecture. An integrated approach is needed to build a model of talker evaluation, which must include a complex set of linguistic, social cognitive, and situational objects. The current results suggest that the object(s) that primarily drives talker evaluations is not the talker’s dialect itself."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"The methods of spatial statistics have been successfully applied to the study of linguistic variation, especially for detecting the existence of spatial patterns in the geographical distribution of linguistic features. However, the use of local indicators of spatial autocorrelation for detecting spatial clusters have been limited to continuous variables, and we propose to apply the new method of Anselin and Li (2019) for categorical variables to linguistic data. We illustrate this method with the case of Japanese rendaku , or sequential voicing, whose dialectal variation is still poorly documented. Focusing on regional differences in the frequency of rendaku, we examined the occurrence of rendaku for four lexemes in 4,921 place names from all Japan. A statistical analysis of local spatial association and an unsupervised density-based cluster analysis revealed the existence of two cluster areas of high rendaku frequency centered around Wakayama and Fukushima-Yamagata prefectures. This suggests that rendaku is more frequent in those dialects, and we recommend that further studies in the dialectal variation of rendaku start by looking at those areas."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Recent sociophonetic research has focused on the ways in which race and ethnicity influence language as well as how language is used to construct racial and ethnic identity. Comparisons of the speech of members of one ethnic group across different regions are still uncommon. In this study, fifty-one native American English speakers of Korean descent, hailing from three different dialect areas of the United States (Los Angeles County and Orange County, California; Harris County, Texas; and Gwinnett County, Georgia), were recorded speaking English in casual interviews. Their speech was analyzed for characteristics of local sound patterns in each region, including the Short Front Vowel Shift (California Vowel Shift) and the Southern Vowel Shift, as well as overall Vowel Space Area. All three groups showed evidence of the Short Front Vowel Shift, and none demonstrated the Southern Vowel Shift. The Californian speakers had the smallest vowel spaces, while the Georgian speakers had the largest. We relate these findings to the ways Korean Americans in Texas and California understand their ethnic identity vis-à-vis a kind of metropolitan or urban speech style in a highly multicultural environment, while, in comparison, Korean Americans in Georgia may use vowel space to highlight their orientation toward or away from local mainstream (white) cultural identity."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Variationist research has much to gain from deepening engagement with theories about place, defined as space imbued with social meaning. One challenge that variationists face is how to adapt the complex and multifaceted aspects of place orientation into a single measure that can be included in models of sociolinguistic variation. In this paper, I advocate for an ethnographic approach to place, providing an example from Greater New Orleans, where post-Katrina displacement has highlighted individual connections to place. Using an ethnographically informed multidimensional place orientation metric (MPOM), I examine two local linguistic features among speakers from the suburban town of Chalmette, Louisiana according to place orientation. Via statistical modeling and case study of individual speakers, I demonstrate the value of MPOMs in quantitative analysis of sociolinguistic variation, arguing for further theorization of place orientation in our research and providing a model for variationist sociolinguists interested in engaging more with place theory."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This article describes the results of a research project carried out over a period of 25 years on the spoken Irish Gaelic of the Aran Islands, Co. Galway, Ireland. It combines microdialectology with sociolinguistics and investigates a wide range of phonological, grammatical, and lexical variables. In addition to revealing complex patterns of geolinguistic variation involving small local areas on the main island and on neighboring islands, it also shows the clear influence of age, gender, and individual creativity on the patterns of variation."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This project uses GIS mapping to analyze spatial trends in spoken language, testing how features identified as part of the “Southern dialect” by the Atlas of North American English ( ANAE ; Labov et al., 2006) are used in the Digital Archive of Southern Speech (DASS; Kretzschmar et al., 2013). We analyze vowel mergers, diphthongization, monophthongization, fronting, and several consonantal features. Rather than drawing isoglosses, we use local spatial autocorrelation analysis to reveal subregional patterning in the data. We present a series of maps illustrating the realization of Southern speech features as enumerated by ANAE . We find little evidence for ANAE ’s Inland South region based on acoustics, and while some areas surveyed in DASS align well with the portrayal of Southern speech presented by ANAE , others do not."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper takes a quantitative perspective on data from the project Syntax hessischer Dialekte (SyHD), covering dialects in the German state of Hesse, an area with rich dialectal variation. Many previous dialectometric analyses abstracted away from intralocal variation (e.g., by only counting the most frequent variant at a location). In contrast, we do justice to intralocal variation by taking into account local frequency relations. The study shows that the border between Low German and Central German—one of the most important isoglosses in German dialectology—is not relevant for syntactic phenomena. At the same time, a comparison with character n -grams (a global measure of string similarity) reveals that the traditionally assumed dialect areas, primarily defined according to phonological developments, are still present in the twenty-first century data. Different from previous studies, our results are obtained from a uniform data base. Therefore, the differences between syntax and phonology cannot be due to variation in sampling, elicitation method, or time of elicitation."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper discusses the regional variation in four ongoing sound changes in the Dutch vowels /eː,øː,oː,ɛi,œy/ that are conditioned by a following coda /l/. The synchronic diatopic diffusion of these changes is charted using the Dutch teacher corpus, a comprehensive dataset containing word-list data from four regions in The Netherlands and four in Flanders. Comparisons are made of the five vowels preceding nonapproximant consonants and preceding coda /l/. To avoid manually segmenting the oftentimes highly gradient vowel–/l/ boundary, GAMMs are used to model whole formant trajectories. Comparisons are then made of trajectories and of peaks of trajectories. The results are used to classify the nature of the four sound changes in terms of phonetic and lexical abruptness/graduality and to show that the changes are intertwined in such a way that they can only be considered as separate facets of a single, currently ongoing vowel shift."

Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper identifies the main dialects within Nyamwezi, a Bantu language of Tanzania, and clarifies the historical relationship between these Nyamwezi (F.22) dialects and Sukuma (F.21). I claim, contrary to the conventional wisdom regarding these languages, that a rough linguistic border exists, which separates the Nyamwezi varieties from Sukuma. By implication, Sukuma and Nyamwezi do not exist in a dialect continuum with one another, and the Ndala lect described in Maganga and Schadeberg (1992) should be considered Sukuma. These claims are supported by primarily lexical and phonological evidence gathered during recent surveys conducted by SIL International. Furthermore, Batibo's (2000) relative chronology of the main innovations considered in this present study (* c /* j fricativization, Bantu spirantization, Dahl's Law, and * p -lenition) is re-examined in light of this new evidence. This paper demonstrates how diachronic dialectology can shed light on the dualistic processes of divergence and convergence in Bantu, and the resulting spread of linguistic innovation."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Texas German is a new world language variety that shows some evidence of koiné development but also presents with substantial variation at many levels of structure. I present a case study on the variant pronunciation of sibilants in Texas German consonant clusters. This feature is fairly frequent and found throughout the regions of German settlement in Central Texas. After a discussion of the presence of this feature in the donor dialects, I investigate the factors that correlate with variation in the modern language. From an analysis of local and global spatial autocorrelation, I argue that variation is not significantly associated with particular geographic regions and is compatible with stable and homogenous variation. This provides insight into our understanding of new dialect emergence and the mechanisms by which dialect features are leveled over multiple generations."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Studies on the correlations between spatial distribution of linguistic varieties and genetic structure of populations began by dealing with geographic spaces and extensive linguistic families. In the last two decades, researchers with this type of interdisciplinary approach have also begun to study more reduced linguistic and population domains. This paper examines geolinguistic and onomastic information in a linguistic and administrative space of a limited extension of the Principality of Asturias. The information on the surnames of this region, taken from the inhabitants’ register, is used to identify surname regions and check correlations with dialect areas described in this space. The results obtained in this research show many similarities in the distribution of surname regions with dialect areas recognized by traditional dialectology studies. The conclusions of the study present the results obtained together with some of the explanatory proposals on the historical constitution of the linguistic diversity of this area."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper investigated origin identification in Jiangsu province, China. In total, ten localities were involved, including nine from Jiangsu province and the city of Beijing. Listeners were presented with recordings of forty speakers (four speakers from each locality) speaking local Mandarin and were asked to identify the region of origin of the speaker and score their Mandarin. Results revealed significant effects of speaker dialect and listener dialect in the identification of speaker origin. Firstly, listeners were able to make distinctions between speakers of Jiangsu province dialect and speakers of non-Jiangsu province dialect (Beijing speakers). Secondly, listeners from Jiangsu province were significantly better than non-Jiangsu listeners at correctly identifying the origin of speakers. In addition, we found significant effects of speaker gender, speaker dialect proficiency, listener dialect proficiency, and speaker Mandarin rating on the identification accuracy of speaker origin in individual analyses of dialect areas."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This paper investigates German /l/-vocalization in the dialect region of South/Central Bavarian. In Austria, /l/-vocalization is said to be restricted to Central Bavarian, constituting the most salient dialect feature. However, its existence within the transition zone of South/Central Bavarian, including the urban and surrounding area of Graz, is often assumed. By analyzing natural speech data of different age groups from Greater Graz in a formal and an informal communication situation, we see that /l/-vocalization is already a well-established phenomenon, whereby the older age-group vocalizes considerably more often than the younger one. This suggests that /l/-vocalization serves as a sociolinguistic rather than a dialect marker indicating regional identity."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This article presents the results of an interdisciplinary project that explores street name changes in Leipzig, a city in eastern Germany, over the past one-hundred years. Our analysis focuses on the ways in which semantic choices in the streetscape are recruited to canonize traces of the national past that are “supportive of the hegemonic socio-political order” (Azaryahu, 1997:480). We triangulate results from variationist sociolinguistics, Linguistic Landscape (LL) studies and geographical analysis to visualize waves of street (re)naming during a century of political turmoil. Drawing on historical archival data allows us to interpret spatial and temporal patterns of odonymic choices as the public embodiment of subsequent political state ideologies. The analysis provides quantitative and longitudinal support to Scollon and Scollon’s (2003) claim that the indexing of officially sanctioned identity and ideology as well as the appropriation of human space are performed by and in turn index state-hegemonic politics of memory."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Who as a restrictive relativizer in English is an old change from above. In urban dialects, it still acts as a prestige form, whereas it is infrequent or negligible in rural British and American varieties. We compare earlier findings from Toronto, the largest city in the province of Ontario (D’Arcy &amp; Tagliamonte, 2010), with a range of communities from the Ontario Dialects Project (Tagliamonte, 2003–present). While none of the rural locations has as much who as Toronto, there is a substantial range. Regions along the major highways to the north and east of the city have more who , while the smaller towns in less accessible locations have less, consistent with a Cascade Model effect (Labov, 2003). Nonetheless, who shows evidence of diffusion, increasing in apparent time in recent decades. We suggest that this reflects overt pressure from above, consistent with the enduring role that prestige plays in English relativizer variation."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Phonetic spelling was common practice in English dialect texts until the API (English: IPA), in 1893, launched its normative signs of transcription. Nevertheless, phonetic spellings have rarely been studied, the least in dialects. This paper ventures to trace some of the immanent norms and the sound functions of some phonetic spellings in the Isle of Wight during the Late Modern English period. The investigation is mainly based on data retrieved from EDD Online , which allows for sophisticated aggregate queries so that spelling practices can be quantified and mapped. The paper focuses on spellings unique to the island, such as double a, e , and o before another vowel, that is, in diphthongs, and u -spellings for schwa in posttonic syllables. The figures for non-unique features, such as voicing of fricatives, are normalized and allow for correlation to other counties. In sum, the Isle of Wight accent was marked by its typical “drawl.”"
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"This analysis examines the ways in which a single speaker, Ana, born in mid-century East Los Angeles, organizes and reflects upon her experiences of the city through language. Ana’s story is one that sheds light on the experiences of many Mexican Americans who came of age at a critical time in a transitioning L.A., and the slow move of people who had been up until mid-century relegated largely in and around racially and socioeconomically segregated parts of L.A. These formative experiences are demonstrated to have informed the ways that speakers parse the social and geographical landscape along several dimensions, and this analysis interrogates the symbolic value of a special category of everyday language, deixis , to reveal the intersection between language and social experience in the cityscape of L.A. In this way, it is analytically possible to not only approach the habituation and reproduction of specific deictic fields as indexical of the ways that speakers parse the city, but also to demonstrate the ways in which key moments in the history of the city have shaped the emergence and meaning of those fields."
Journal of Linguistic Geography,"Language documentation has been carried out in Iran since the late 1800s but in a sporadic way, and even now, the scholarly picture of the country’s linguistic landscape is fragmentary. The present article responds to this state of affairs in a modest way by working toward a systematic overview of the language situation in one area of the country: Chahar Mahal va Bakhtiari Province of western Iran, where the high Zagros Mountains open onto the Iranian Plateau. In this study, conducted in the context of the Atlas of the Languages of Iran (ALI) research programme, we chronicle our research process for this region, beginning with an inventory of languages spoken here—varieties of Bakhtiari, Charmahali, and Turkic—and an overview of their geographical distribution. This initial step enabled us to select 30 varieties from 26 locations across the province for in-depth research, including implementation of the ALI language data questionnaire. Data generated by the study have resulted in two language distribution maps as well as a series of linguistic structure maps. Initial analysis of lexical and phonological data provides insight into defining features of each language as well as structures shared between them as a result of language contact in the region."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"German-speaking Switzerland can certainly be regarded as one of the liveliest and at the same time best researched dialect areas in Central Europe. It is all the more surprising that dialectometric analyses in this area have only recently been performed and none of them included an investigation into the level of syntax. In this paper we pursue two goals: First, we present digital data that has been made available in recent years on the basis of the Sprachatlas der deutschen Schweiz (SDS) and the Syntaktischer Atlas der deutschen Schweiz (SADS). Our second goal is to present dialectometric analyses performed with this data. A special focus is put on the comparison of different linguistic levels (lexis, phonology, morphology and syntax). Our methods include hierarchical cluster analyses (of the whole dataset as well as of the linguistic levels), correlations (between pairs of linguistic levels and between linguistic levels and geography) and parameter maps which allow us to draw conclusions about the distributions of innovative and conservative regions, dialect centers and transition zones. Our results show that while all four levels generally yield similar geographic patterns (dynamic areas in the North vs. conservative areas in the South, agreement of dialect and cantonal borders, high correlations with geography), syntax deviates most from the other levels."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"In this paper a range of methods for measuring the phonetic distance between dialectal variants are described. It concerns variants of the frequency method, the frequency per word method and Levenshtein distance, both simple (based on atomic characters) and complex (based on feature bundles). The measurements between feature bundles used Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance or (a measure using) Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Variants of these using feature weighting by entropy reduction were systematically compared, as was the representation of diphthongs (as one symbol or two). The dialects were compared with each other directly and indirectly via a standard dialect. The results of comparison were classified by clustering and by training of a Kohonen map. The results were compared to wellestablished scholarship in dialectology, yielding a calibration of the methods. These results indicate that the frequency per word method and the Levenshtein distance outperform the frequency method, that feature representations are more sensitive, that Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance are good measures of phonetic overlap of feature bundles, that weighting is not useful, that two-phone representations of diphthongs mostly outperform one-phone representations, and that dialects should be directly compared to each other. The results of clustering give the sharper classification, but the Kohonen map is a nice supplement."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The aim of the present investigation 1 was to get an impression of the geographic influences on the dialectal variation in a country. In previous investigations, the correlations between linguistic distances and geographic distances using dialect data from the Netherlands and Norway were calculated (Gooskens and Heeringa 2004, Nerbonne et al. 1996). The results showed a high correlation in the case of Dutch data while the correlation was considerably lower in the case of Norwegian data. This seems to reflect the fact that especially for Norway the direct distance between two settlements does not reflect the difficulty of travel and therefore social contact, which is expected to play a role in keeping linguistic distance within limits. Holland is a country with a flat, regularly populated landscape with few natural obstacles such as mountains and rivers. This is in great contrast with Norway with its high mountains and many fjords which made it quite difficult to travel between places, especially in the past. These differences in geographical situations are clearly reflected in the correlations between the linguistic and geographical distances between the dialects of the two countries. The present investigation is searching for more successful ways of predicting linguistic distances by means of geographic distances in Norway. To this end, old and new traveling data were used providing information about traveling times by road, train, and boat between the places where the different dialects are spoken. The results show that a large part of the linguistic variation can be accounted for by geography in Norway, just as in the Netherlands. However, in the case of a geographically more compli"
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The Majorcan dialectologist Antoni M. Alcover (1862–1932) was the first researcher to record information for use in the study of the conjugation of Catalan verbs. He compiled almost 500,000 verb forms corresponding to the complete conjugation of 75 verbs in 149 localities in the Catalan-speaking area. These data were published under the title “La flexió verbal en els dialectes catalans”. From 1999, work began to complete and computerize these materials in order to make them accessible to scholars in the field and to the public. These computer applications have a descriptive character: they show dialectal and subdialectal areas, and isoglosses, in a graphic form. However, it is also possible to use these materials from an interpretative point of view. The aim of this paper is to apply a suitable dialectometric analysis to the “Verbal flexion” materials, which can only be interpreted using quantitative analysis techniques. Taking multiple answers into account, we use the calculation of the Mean Degree of Confluence and we compare the results with the dialectometric analysis obtained applying Hans Goebl's methodology, which is based on the use of single answers."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The major aim of this paper is to demonstrate through the grammar of the verb phrase in Standard English (StdE) and Nigerian Pidgin English (NPE) that NPE is a distinct language. The paper draws on data collected from 30 Nigerian University Graduates from three ethnolinguistic regions. Although many scholars have pointed out that NPE is a language (Agheyisi, West African Pidgin: Simplification and Simplicity, University of Stanford, 1971; Elugbe and Omamor, Nigerian Pidgins: Background and Prospects, Heinemann, 1991), not many of them have examined the verb phrase in NPE with a view to showing that its grammar is distinctive. It has been shown in this paper that the NPE verb phrase is sharply different from StdE verb phrase, and because the verb is at the centre of the clause and can determine its argument, it can be argued that NPE whose verbal grammar is radically different from that of English is a separate language. The pattern of clustering of NPE verb phrases with other NPE verb phrases or other crieterial features of NPE is also a demonstration that NPE is a distinct language. Finally, the subjects made sharp switches from StdE to NPE, speaking in blocks of first one code and then the other: this is like the behaviour of bilinguals moving from one language to another."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Given its early date, breadth of coverage (geographical and linguistic) and the huge amount of data it contains, Alexander Ellis's The Existing Phonology of English Dialects marks an extremely significant episode in British dialectology. Despite this, there has been very little in the way of detailed linguistic analysis of Ellis’s survey, and no attempt has been made to construct a linguistic atlas from the data it contains, although several studies have included a few preliminary maps based on it. Why is this so, and what might we discover if we did investigate this early survey of the dialects of English and Scots in more detail? The aim of this paper is to begin such an investigation and, in particular, to demonstrate that there is considerable mileage (and benefit) in mapping the data in Ellis (1889)."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The traditional focus of (German) dialectology has been on spatial patterns observed in phonology. However, dialectometric approaches have generated interest in exploring geographical structures in other linguistic subsystems, including morphology. Building on this research, this study investigates geolinguistic patterns of dialect morphology in contemporary Austrian dialects using aggregative and non-aggregative measures, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and Cluster Analysis (CA). Data are based on a comprehensive dialect survey with 163 speakers from 40 locations across Austria, examining 120 linguistic variables related to inflection. The results show a clear geographic structuring of morphological variation, which significantly differs from traditional dialect classifications. The analysis of the linguistic basis of the geographical patterns suggests that these differences might be ascribed to methodological factors and language change. Methodologically, it is also demonstrated that the findings of aggregative and non-aggregative methods are complementary, not contradictory. Ultimately, the study underscores the importance of integrating diverse methods to gain a comprehensive understanding of geographical patterns in dialect variation."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Dialect atlases comprise considerable numbers of linguistic feature maps, i.e. dialect maps representing one linguistic feature each. Large amounts of data like these are often difficult to handle. This article presents a new quantitative method for the automatic analysis of such large corpora of linguistic feature maps. It makes use of geographical similarities between single maps to establish a system of criteria for structural relatedness. Furthermore, it employs statistical techniques to test whether given linguistic relations between the maps coincide significantly with structural relations. To achieve this, each underlying point-symbol map is converted into an area-class map (with all the original information still available). These area-class maps yield additional information regarding their structural composition. Cluster analysis is then employed to obtain groupings of similar maps. Such groupings facilitate the search for language-internal factors that influence the geographical distribution of linguistic variants, as the relevance of any given linguistic parameter for spatial patterns can be tested using statistical methods. Moreover, language-external factors, such as topographical conditions, can be tested in the same way. Thus, this new method allows for a profound and substantiated investigation of the regularities that can be found in the geographical distributions of linguistic variants."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"How do speakers of current Turkish and Moroccan ethnolects of Dutch deal with phonemes that do not exist in their heritage languages and that are at the same time subject to pronounced regional and social variation in the Dutch speech community at large, such as the Dutch diphthong /εi/? This diphthong does not occur in Turkish and Berber and it occurs only as a dialectal allophone in certain dialects of Moroccan Arabic. Data from speakers from the Amsterdam and Nijmegen urban areas are studied. In the Amsterdam dialect, the diphthong is traditionally subject to monophthongization and lowering, yielding realizations as [a:] or [a:], while in Nijmegen the diphthong is only subject to monophthongization, resulting in the variant [ε:]. Recently, a new lowered, diphthongal variant [ai] entered colloquial spoken standard Dutch. Therefore, ethnolect speakers have a wide range of variants to ‘choose’ from: the traditional standard Dutch variant [εi], the new variant [ai], which is expanding areally and socially, and the monophthongal variants of the surrounding urban dialects. Two variable properties of /εi/ are examined: (1) height of the prominent first element, and (2) the degree of monophthongization. The urban dialect features which had developed into sociolect features over the past generations appear to be undergoing social redistribution to become ethnolect markers."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Ternary deictic system in Aromanian Adverbs of place of the type here, there, which form a binary system met in many languages, can be considered as local or spatial deictic elements. In Ibero-Romance languages (Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan) a ternary deictic system appears which, regionally, can be found in dialects of the Romanian language, i.e. Aromanian and Dacoromanian. This paper deals with the spatial deictic system using three terms in Aromanian and comparing them to the Romance and Balkan (Albanian) languages; this information is compared with the situation observed in another local dialect. The presence of the ternary deictic system in some Romance languages, as well as in Slavic ones and in Albanian, around which Aromanian developed (especially the Fãrşerot local dialect), proves that there is a Romance tendency developed within the Balkan context in Aromanian, too."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The article focuses on some intonational features of three Romance languages spoken in northern Sardinia (Algherese Catalan, Logudorese Sardinian, and the Sardinian regional variety of Italian). The first part of the article shows, by means of both qualitative and quantitative analyses, that the above-mentioned languages share some intonational features that are not present in the dialects of Catalan and Italian spoken in the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula, respectively. In the following sections the article puts forward a diachronic explanation for this intonational convergence, basing on the role of Sardinian as a substrate language for both Algherese Catalan and the regional Italian of Sardinia. The final part of the article proposes a generalization of the findings of the case-study and puts forward a diachronic model of prosodic transfer that includes the mechanisms of direct transfer, fusion, and accommodation."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Coda-final consonant deletion has been extensively documented in Eastern Andalusian Spanish; however, its effects on neighbouring segments is still unknown. Scholars working on consonant deletion in Eastern Andalusian Spanish have mainly focused on /s/, given the semantic importance of this consonant in Spanish. As a result, other consonants which are often deleted syllable-finally in this geolect have been studied to a much lesser degree. The present paper aims to expand the traditional view on vowel doubling by analysing /-s/, /-r/, and /-Ɵ/ deletion before /a/. Firstly, the speech of 24 speakers from El Ejido (Eastern Andalusia) is analysed to ascertain how the deletion of word final /s/, /r/, and /Ɵ/ changes the quality of a preceding /a/. Secondly, a perception test is carried out with native speakers from the local area to confirm whether these speakers can differentiate perceptually between word-final /a/ and /a/ preceding underlying /-s/, /-r/, or /-Ɵ/. This paper presents two main conclusions: 1) /-s/, /-r/, and /-Ɵ/ deletion changes the quality of a preceding /a/ to different degrees; 2) EAS speakers can identify whether /a/ is followed or not by an underlying /-s/, /-r/, or /-Ɵ/, but they cannot identify which consonant has been deleted in each case."

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Galician and Portuguese have a common origin. This genetic affiliation is not accompanied by any historical continuity (Monteagudo 2012: 38), as these language varieties were separated in a distant past, mainly through the establishment of a political and administrative boundary between their territories. This lack of contact is interesting when studying common and divergent linguistic phenomena, in particular in the field of prosody and intonation, as it presupposes a challenge to historical study, given that we only recently have sound recordings of speech. Our proposal is therefore to contribute towards a diachronic study of the intonation of absolute interrogatives in Galician and Portuguese by using synchronic data collected over the past decade. We aim to show the usefulness of the quantitative method of measuring prosodic distances, because it enables us to determine geographic areas using common standards and shows the degree of separation between the intonations of the two varieties."

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The lack of homogeneous data recorded by similar methodologies has been a handicap to the development of more advanced studies on the dialectal variation of Basque. Now that the first five volumes of the Linguistic Atlas of the Basque Language have been published, researchers have access to a great amount of data and the possibility to use more sophisticated procedures to analyze the variation of the Basque language from a geolinguistic point of view. In this contribution, we use data taken from the fifth volume of this atlas, which is devoted to noun morphology. First, these data will be analyzed linguistically, and instead of using the phonetic representation, we will use the phonological or underlying representation. In order to do this, we will analyze the inventory of the morphological suffixes used in nominal inflexion cases and the phonological rules which appear in these cases (mainly assimilation, dissimilation, insertion and deletion), using the classical view of generative phonology. As far as the cartography of the data is concerned, we will use the recently created Diatech tool, instead of other dialectometrical tools, because of the multiple responses (MR) which that data show. In effect, the Diatech tool provides a more accurate processing of the MR than other tools. As well as conceptual maps, synthetic maps will be presented; these maps will show different geographical organizations of the suffixes and phonological rules."

In Modern Irish numerous simple prepositions not only form compounds with possessive forms of personal pronouns but additionally marshal an impressive array of ‘conjugated’ forms corresponding to the various grammatical persons.

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The methodological aspects that characterize any dialectal survey were defined in Jules Gilliéron's Atlas Linguistique de la France (Champion, 1902–1910) and they were the starting point for later dialectal works. From then on, the number of informants interviewed, the qualities of the researcher or the typology of the questionnaire are characteristics that determine the design and the realization of any atlas. This paper examines different methodological aspects related to the dialectal survey and proposes a method that gives account of the progressive variation observed in the speakers of a cohesive dialectal territory."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This article discusses how language change and diffusion in Tarifit (Rif-Berber, North Morocco) can be explained by system-internal factors.The examined cases examined concern several innovation processes triggered by the vocalisation phenomenon of the liquids /r/ and /ṛ/ and involving both phonological and morphological features and structures.The analyses presented analyses confirm that innovation can also be formally motivated, which refutes Croft's (2000: 38) claim that only functional factors can induce language change.Moreover, they show how functional properties may determine the success of the diffusion of variants.As such, they offer evidence against the claim that only social factors are accountable for variant selection (Milroy 1992: 201-202; Croft 2000: 38, 54).The considered data considered in this contribution come from the Atlas Linguistique des variétés berbères du Rif (Lafkioui 2007), a geolinguistic study of the Berber varieties of North Morocco."

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The goal of this paper is to offer an overview of the grammatical and lexical properties of spatial categories in Aquilan, an Italian dialect. The paper shows that spatial prepositions (e.g. a ‘at/to’, ‘nfronte a ‘in front of’), pronouns and indexicals (e.g. pe‘nfronte lit. ‘to in front (of a place)’, loc’arrete ‘there behind’, respectively) share two key properties. The first, a lexical property, is their ability to refer to the location of discourse referent, whence the “spatial” label. The second, a grammatical property, is their similar distribution in sentences and discourse contexts. The paper thoroughly presents these Aquilan data and sketches, as a theoretical analysis that connects these categories into a unified account."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Tracing the diffusion of linguistic innovations in space from historical sources is challenging. The complexity of the datasets needed in combination with the noisy reality of historical language data mean that it has not been practical until recently. However, bigger historical corpora with richer spatial and temporal information allow us to attempt it. This paper presents an investigation into changes affecting first person non-singular pronouns in the history of Norwegian: first, individual changes affecting the dual ( vit &gt; mit ) and plural ( vér &gt; mér ), followed by loss of the dual-plural distinction by merger into either form or replacement of both by Danish-Swedish vi . To create dynamic spatial visualisations of these changes, the use of kernel density estimation is proposed. This term covers a range of statistical tools depending on the kernel function. The paper argues for a Gaussian kernel in time and an adaptive uniform ( k -nearest neighbours) kernel in space, allowing uncertainty or multiple localisation to be incorporated into calculations. The results for this dataset allow us to make a link between Modern Norwegian dialectological patterns and language use in the Middle Ages; they also exemplify different types of diffusion process in the spread of linguistic innovations."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Repetition is a natural phenomenon employed to perform a variety of cognitive, psychological, interactional, stylistic, didactic and pragmatic functions in spoken and written discourse. Adopting the method of discourse analysis, the study attempts to explore the pragmatic functions of repetitions as used in spoken dialect narrative discourse. On a propositional level, only those repetitions which establish and maintain co-reference are necessary, all other forms seem to be redundant. However, if we take into account their pragmatic functions, they are not, as the data gathered in the study show. In fact, speakers use them, deliberately or not, as an effective communication strategy in the following functions: to extend the planning time to find a suitable lexeme, to enhance the importance of a lexeme, to emphasize the length of an event, after an interruption, to eliminate uncertainty and to confirm the correctness of the co-speaker’s statement. They also reveal the speakers emotions, like his/her emotional shock, and are used as a part of the so-called conversational duet. The data include the transcripts of the interviews with 6 dialect speakers in the Brda/Collio region, western Slovenia."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"In variationist linguistics, the concept of implicational hierarchies, i.e. the idea that feature x implies y but not the reverse, has passed into oblivion the last decades (cf.

This paper aims at showing the usefulness of implicational scales as an analytical tool, especially when attempting to understand stylistic dynamics and the structure of intermediate variations in dialect/ standard continua. The discussion is based on results from empirical research in Flanders, where intermediate language use between dialect and standard language (the so-called tussentaal ) is increasingly prevalent. In general, tussentaal is conceived of as the whole continuum of regionally coloured language use in between the poles ‘traditional dialect’ and ‘standard language’, and it is hence said to differ from region to region, situation to situation and even from speaker to speaker (Willemyns 2005: 31). Necessary and sufficient conditions would be impossible to define (cf. De Caluwe 2006: 19). This paper however demonstrates, on the basis of quantitative analyses of nine language features as used by ten West Flemish speakers in three types of speech settings, that tussentaal is not just a random idiolectal mix of dialect features, but that it is structured by implicational principles shared across the speech community."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Missionary linguistics and considerations of Nahuatl as a lingua franca lead us to propose that Nahuatlisms have historically been prominent in American Spanish. Diachronic studies show that after Spanish spelling was standardised, involving occasional losses and extensions of meaning, Aztec words were incorporated into Spanish language vocabularies in the Americas. Because 16 th and 17 th -century data provide inconsistent depictions of the spread of Nahuatlisms in the Caribbean and in South American regions, our research aims to collect data from American Spanish dialectal vocabularies to reconstruct regionalisation and diffusion trends of Nahuatlisms in the centuries that followed. Utilising quantitative and qualitative methodologies, we design a research study that identifies restricted and regional characteristics of more than 84% of Nahuatlisms and of remnants of Nahuatl words in the Caribbean and in South American regions."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The aim of this paper is to present a small selection of linguistic facts that describe currents and contrasts in the Cisalpine Valleys, relying on some ALEPO [Atlante Linguistico ed Etnografico del Piemonte Occidentale – Linguistic and Ethnographic Atlas of Western Piedmont] data. The area investigated is characterized by a close relationship between different languages and cultures. As it is well known, the Gallo-Italic languages of Piedmont are spoken along with local dialects of two Gallo-Romance languages, Occitan and Franco-Provençal; Italian (and, in some areas, French) obviously has to be added to this rich linguistic repertoire. Data have been collected in 42 localities: 32 pertaining to the Gallo-Romance domain (13 Franco-Provençal- and 19 Occitan-speaking); and 10 belonging to the Gallo-Italic one. The localities in question have been chosen ta take account of both social and linguistic dynamics. Socio-cultural and economic changes that deeply affected the Alpine Valleys in the last century have also had linguistic consequences, with increasing Italian and Piedmontese influence on varieties of Gallo-Romance, and of Italian on Piedmontese; nevertheless, some instances of mutual influencing between Occitan and Franco-Provençal are also documented, as well as significant reactions on the part of these varieties to dominant codes (namely Piedmontese, Italian, and French). We deal here with language change at three levels of linguistic analysis (lexical, morphological, and phonetic), showing moreover how a traditional reading of the maps may also yield results of sociolinguistic import."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Catalan includes six dialectal areas. In general, all of them are subdivided into subdialects. Eastern Catalan incorporates five subdialects: the northern transitional subdialect, the subdialects of Barcelona and Tarragona, and the so-called xipella and salat subdialects, which have only been defined by one dialectal feature. These particular traits are dying out at the moment. The aim of this paper is to study the process of extinction of the salat subdialect. The project L'arxiu audiovisual del parlar salat de la Costa Brava (The archive of the salat subdialect of the Costa Brava), started in 2004, shows the vitality of this subdialect and its present-day situation."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Linguistic Change in Southwest German: from apical to uvular r We start with a brief description of the realization of /r/ in standard German and proceed to examine the evolution of the /r/ in Alemannic dialects in general. We then look at the specific conditions which apply to the /r/ in southwest Germany. Recordings for the ‘Atlas of Southwest German’ demonstrate a multitude of variations of the /r/; in the west, the uvular R dominates, whereas in the east the apical r is the most common realization. In the area around Lake Constance, there is a third variant, namely dorsal r. According to the definition of sound change established by Haag (Teuthonista 6: 1–35, 1929), the change from apical to uvular r should be classified as the older one; it was a conscious adoption of uvular r, first by speakers in towns and their immediate surroundings, which then became incorporated into regional dialects. The transformation of lingual to dorsal r, on the other hand, is regarded in Haag's terms as a current sound change, which is still in progress."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This paper explores the relations between three domains dealing with linguistic variation: dialectology, typology, and contact linguistics. It aims to contribute to dialectal research that also considers syntactic questions, exploring the syntactic domain of comparative constructions of superiority in Purepecha (a language isolate spoken in Mexico). I demonstrate that the expression of the comparison of superiority can be mapped onto the language by means of ten constructions, which may be divided into four types, showing that language contact can lead to the emergence of new types. This study points out that the consequences of language contact are not homogeneous, but fall into various types of construction aligned with local specificities and geographical distribution. I argue that the integration of dialectology, typology, and contact linguistics results in a dynamic and multidimensional organization, which I characterize as a multi-layered perspective."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"To manually detect geometric structures in large quantities of dialect maps is a tedious and error-prone (if not impossible) task. Methods from stochastic image analysis and pattern recognition can help to automate, objectify and thus facilitate this process. This paper presents a quantitative method for detection of ellipsoid patterns and their centers in dialect maps using the Randomized Hough Transform . It will outline the necessary parameters, which are fully customizable, thus making the method adaptable to any kind of map. The centers of these structures can be divided into two types, a geographic and a linguistic one. Previous approaches were unable to make such a distinction. It will be argued that the aggregations of such linguistic centers could best be described as attractors of a dynamic system."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"In this paper, a phase of language divinisation is posited as the deeply-rooted origin of the standard language/variety ideology, which devalues the nonstandard dialects thus causing a permanent sociolinguistic conflict. Present linguistic standardisation is seen as the form divinisation has taken in the course of the history of humankind and it is justified by the search of stability and functionality for organised speech communities, which is not objectionable as such for some aspects of social life. The sociolinguistic conflict emerges because the first stage of the process requires the selection of usually one variety (or more than one in some cases) out of the dialectal complex of any natural language, generally responding to class-related interests allied to power and prestige. It is evidently, an ideological issue. Our approach to this problem is based on data from the Spanish-speaking world, analysed mainly on a minimal unitary phonetological approach (MUPA) in search of different dialectal dimensions and parameters. MUPA is justified and possible because of the great cohesiveness of Spanish varieties. When attention is paid to this extensive linguistic dominion, one finds that the notion of the inevitability of the weakening of regional varieties has to be revised."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The recent publication of EDD Online version 3.0 (March 2019), based on Joseph Wright’s English Dialect Dictionary (1898-1905), raises the question of what this last version, again provided by an Innsbruck project team, has added or changed in comparison to the previous ones. This paper describes the main improvements, focusing on five points: (1) the integration of the Supplement , (2) the implementation of a new kwic concordance, (3) the elaboration of the sorting modes applicable on the result lists after queries, (4) the new possibilities of quantifying retrievals, and (5) the elaboration of the last-result mode allowing more parameters and filters to be compatible with each other. The last chapter sketchily refers to further assets of the new version. The paper illustrates all its points by practical examples and screen shots. In doing so, it also provides an introduction to the sophisticated search tools now available in our interface and to the enormous dialectological and lexicographic potential of the digitised version of the most comprehensive English dialect dictionary ever published."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This paper focuses on phonetic variation within the standard German language register of Austria. While the norm status and a high socio-symbolic value are attributed to certain lexical variants of standard language in Austria, the norm and usage status of characteristic phonetic properties remain unclear, due to lack of empirical analyses. By investigating the relation between standard language norms and “standard usage” ( Gebrauchsstandard ) in Austria, our study aims to close this research gap by using the example of unstressed ‹-ig›. The analyses are based on data gathered from 52 speakers from two generations, covering all Austrian dialect regions. Elicitation settings varied from strongly standardized tasks with a graphic or visual stimulus (reading aloud tasks, picture naming tasks) to translation tasks (translation from dialect into standard) with oral stimuli. The results demonstrate that although ‹-ig› is predominantly pronounced like [ɪk], (socio-)linguistic factors as phonetic context, part of speech, setting, gender and regional background influence the ‹-ig›-variation. In total, the data suggest that German speaking Austrians are situated in a conflict between transnationally diverging norms and intra-nationally varying model speakers of German."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This paper analyzes the specific linguistic situation of print media in German language abroad based on the example of the “Batschkaer Spuren”, a regional newspaper of the German minority in Hungary. The goal is a linguistic assessment of the current manifestations of the used media language regarding its typological structures and fundamental characteristics. Additionally, journalistic possibilities and types of procedures, specifically with regards to regionalisms (informed by local dialects), multilingualism, and inter- as well as transculturality are discussed. The study identified a spectrum of minority-specific patterns und types of linguistic composition with highly variable characteristics of German. The analyzed linguistic practices of the newspaper show a type of dynamic multiliteracy that in itself causes an emergence of new patterns. The majority of findings can be attributed to multilingual or language-contact induced phenomena on different levels: from word to text/discourse (the text routines are occasionally influenced by the contact language Hungarian). The other central aspect of the analyzed text world lies in the regionalisms that are influenced by local dialects. The complete picture is determined by heterogeneity and inconsistency and presents itself as a mixture of linguistic and stylistic forms. Especially noteworthy is the established conflict between orality and scribality i.e., between a “language of proximity” and a “language of distance”. Hence, the analyzed newspaper articles present a large quantity of forms and structures of every-day written language that metaphorically can be termed “Parlando texts”."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This paper provides a dialectological account of the variety spoken by the first generation to grow up in a community in Essex populated by East Londoners after World War II. The dialect spoken by 15 speakers (female = 9; male =6) born between 1944 and 1969 is detailed in terms of vowels, consonants, morpho-syntactic features, and a brief discussion of Cockney Rhyming Slang. Comparisons are made with previous accounts of the working-class, East London dialect, Cockney, as well as the dialects of Essex (East London’s neighbouring county), East Anglia, South East England and Multicultural London English, the dialect now prevalent in the speech of young East Londoners. There are remarkable similarities between the English spoken in this Essex community and previous accounts of Cockney, including its most defining features. This Essex dialect is certainly encapsulated within the natural range of variation within Cockney and far surpasses the Cockney influences observed in other areas of the South East. Conclusively it can be determined that Cockney did move to Essex along with the communities who relocated."

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The western Mediterranean constitutes a traditional zone of meeting of several types of languages and of dialectal profusion. The system can be easily interpreted by means of a diglossic organization between dominated poles (minority languages) and dominant poles (vehicular languages, States languages), clearly recognizable. In an historic phase where the centralist economic pressures are very strong (globalization), it is interesting to question the whole system of these languages and linguistic landscapes, notably the romance landscapes. We can then begin to understand that are appearing particular modalities of management of these different sorts of languages corresponding to three models (France, Spain and Italy). Each of these models gives us an outline of what could become the western Mediterranean in a near future."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This paper deals with a morphological issue, the inflection in Luxemburgish family names. While in colloquial High German only the one inflective form -s is attested in the plural forms of family names, for instance Schmit-s, we discover in colloquial Luxemburgish, besides the different plural forms, the composition ‘family name + first name’, for instance Schmit’s Paul instead of Paul Schmit. First, we give precise details about the morphological complexity of this construction. Next, its numerous connotations are emphasized. Finally, we put the question, if the new attitude of the young generation towards the inflected composite form generates a linguistic development in this local specified field."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"For describing a particular area from a geolinguistic perspective, the basic procedure is to create a two-dimensional table with an axis showing forms or phenomena and another axis showing localities. In this table, observing the specific reaction in every cell will allow us to develop both co-occurrence and coefficient matrixes, as well as clustering and multivariate interpretation graphs. In this table, which is the starting point for multivariate analyses of geolinguistic data, certain convergences and divergences of the reaction points are revealed. Our interest is in a quantitative evaluation of the degree of convergence and divergence that takes the form of a rectangular linkage of the reacted points; that is to say, an analysis of the state of their continuity set out in rectangular plots. In order to evaluate properly the absolute values in numbers of unions (U) it is necessary to develop a mathematical function that will return the maximum number of unions (Umax) in a parameter with the number of reactions (n): Umax (n). Once the Umax function has been established, the desirable “Degree of Binding” will be formulated through the division of U by Umax(n). The aim of this paper is to put into practice this method with the data from La flexió verbal en els dialectes catalans (‘Verbal Flexion’) (1929-1932), by Antoni M. Alcover, previously analysed in Perea &amp; Ueda (2010). The calculation of the Degree of Binding is applied to the data in both its forms: the original data and the patternized distribution of data (see Perea &amp; Ueda 2010: 103-111). The result of our calculations gives rise to a new multivariate perspective of “isoglosses” for overcoming the problems of mismatched lines on the linguistic maps."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"One of the two major dialects of Taiwaesen Southern Min [TSM] has two mid back vowels, /o/ and / ɔ/. This distinction is well documented in classic Chinese phonology and agreed upon by most TSM linguists. However, an increasing number of recent evidence-based studies have reported the falling together of these two vowels and, indeed, many non-linguists as well have noticed the loss of the distinction. Since these two vowels are so similar in nearly all phonetic features most studies carried out heretofore which concluded that the merger had in fact taken place were based on auditory criteria. The present study, however, the methodology of which has been designed to take account of the low literacy rate of TSM speakers, as well as the frequent contact which takes place between TSM dialects, investigates the status of these two vowels making use of both acoustic and statistical data. Results indicate that in TSM /o/ and / ɔ / have merged in the case of younger speakers. Both internal and external factors are proposed which have affected the merger, and the further suggestion is put forward that, though the instance of sound shift reversal in Taiwan is on record, this is not likely to occur in the case of TSM /o/ and / ɔ /."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The article deals with the youngsters in a specific secondary school in Maribor which represents a sort of a conglomerate of different social varieties (dialects) of the Slovenian language. This conglomerate raises particular questions regarding perspectives of Maribor vernacular. The survey is based on 68 questionnaries of secondary school pupils. It was conducted in May 2012 in Maribor. All the pupils of the 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd year were interviewed. Questionnaires differenciated between pupils according to their gender, their grade in the school subject of the Slovenian language and according to their place of residence during their schooling. The analysis included two variables, i.e. gender and grade; nevertheless, the latter did not prove to be relevant. During Slovenian language classes, male pupils use LSS more consistently than female pupils do; they both frequently use SDS-2, as well as SDS-1, while during other classes there is almost no LSS. The pupils are consistently corrected during Slovenian language classes, which is not the case during other classes (with the exceptions of history and geography). For Abbreaviations, see footnote 2, p. 8. At school, pupils more frequently use slang with classmates and peers than they use LDS. Moreover, the comparison between the use of slang by female and male pupils shows the growing use of slang by the latter. All the pupils whose current address is not in Maribor notice the influence of their school environment (of Maribor city speech), including German loan words (also typical of Maribor city speech). All pupils whose current address is not in Maribor use these words in informal speech, i.e. with classmates, school employees and other citizens of Maribor."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Linguistics and Dialectology are two sides of the same coin: the former deals with the rigorous analysis of natural languages and the latter with concrete varieties of language in its cohesive and identifying social roles. Linguistics today is moving towards an integration of its various dimensions: phonology and phonetics are now so intricately tied that the unimodular phonetological approach is gaining ground rapidly; synchrony and diachrony are moving towards a reintegration, thus moving away from their parallel paths; and, finally, the so-called ‘non-structural’ elements of language are gradually being acknowledged as an integral part of the analysis that was traditionally reserved for the ‘structural’ ones. As linguistics moves, so does dialectology, since the latter has always been the laboratory of linguists, even if they have not formally accepted it as such. A new approach to dialectal matters must therefore move away from mere description and search for a more comprehensive analysis that confirms the essential inviolability of the binomial language-society. The traditional view of Hispanic linguistics and dialectology has been a victim of the dichotomic approach: conservative versus radical, Iberian versus American, high lands versus low lands, North-Central Castilian versus ‘Atlantic’ Spanish among others. This paper aims at taking an integrated approach to linguistics and dialectology, with its case study addressing the so called ‘Atlantic’ Spanish and the phonetological changes it is going through in search of a more satisfying explanation of short-term and long-term variability."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This paper examines the acoustic and articulatory characteristics of the fricative realization of /t/ in the dialect of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality, in Nova Scotia, Canada. Two experiments were conducted to determine the similarities and differences betwee fricative /t/, or “slit-t”, and other voiceless coronal sounds. Previous research on this sound in some communities has found it to be more similar to /s/ than /ʃ/, while in other communities it has been found to be more similar to /ʃ/ than /s/. The first experiment conducted was a qualitative analysis of static palatograms of one Cape Breton speaker’s production of six different coronal sounds. Results from this experiment suggest “slit-t” to be articulatorily distinct from both /s/ and /ʃ/. The second experiment conducted was a statistical analysis of several acoustic measurements of six Cape Breton speakers’ production of six different coronal sounds. Results from this experiment suggest “slit-t” is acousticcally distinct from both /s/ and /ʃ/, or rather on a cline between these two sounds."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The use of computerized systems for geolinguistic data processing began in the 1970s with the production of maps for linguistic atlas projects. From that moment, dialect studies have continuously benefitted from the innovations that took place in the field of digital technologies. At present, linguistic geography projects are fully integrated within the Digital Humanities and are governed by the same principles that guide studies in this discipline: the interoperability of applications, free reuse of data and interdisciplinarity. This paper provides a brief outline of the structure and design of the database that currently houses the Atlas Lingüístico Galego materials, a linguistic atlas of Galician begun as a project in the 1970s. This database is being used as an information source for the publication of the project’s volumes, for research into variation and change of Galician varieties, and to contribute to the elaboration of geolinguistic projects that are greater in scope."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"In this paper two simplification techniques are used in order to represent geographical distribution patterns of standard Japanese. The first technique is a representation of two-dimensional geographical distribution patterns in one dimension. The second is the plotting of geographical locations making use of railway distances from cultural centres. By simplifying the two-dimensional geographical distribution into one by railway distance, another dimension on a sheet of paper can show one other characteristic of standard Japanese forms. In order to see the patterns of distribution of Japanese standard forms, numerical data based on the Linguistic Atlas of Japan are utilized. Gravity centres of railway distance are calculated for each standard Japanese form, and correspondence with the degree of nationwide usage and the year of first attestation in historical documents is considered. Two-dimensional graphs (scattergrams) of the three factors are considered."

It is based on widely published material of the Northern Aukštaitian dialect of Panevėžys studies.

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The present article discusses how the combination of structural (qualitative) and algorithmic (quantitative) perspectives provides valuable insights into geolinguistic patterning and variability, and hence testifies to the importance of the integrating approach in addressing geolinguistic complexity. In doing so, it shows how language is constantly modulated in the form of innovations that emerge in structurally layered and causal formations, dictated by a subtle interplay between system-based and system-external properties. A case that accounts for this kind of geolinguistic complexity is provided by this data-driven study on Berber (Afro-asiatic), which shows how certain phonological and morphological innovation processes triggered by the vocalisation of the liquids /r/, /ṛ/, /rr/ and /ṛṛ/ in Rif Berber (North, Northeast, and Northwest Morocco) create language variation and change. Furthermore, the Berber data examined demonstrate the significant role of certain system-internal factors, such as economy and code conformity, in the diffusion of new phonetic, phonological, and morphological items. In order to better understand the intricacy of the various vocalisation phenomena addressed in the study, the results of the qualitative analysis (synchrony and diachrony) are also contrasted with the algorithmic results ensuing from computing geolinguistic distances by means of the Levenshtein distance calculating method with phone strings tokenised in pair-wise alignments (pondered variables)."

The sub-dialects of South-Western Kurzeme have many characteristic features found in their phonetics and morphology. In the South-Western Kurzeme sub-dialects, there are native lexemes – words from the ancient Curonian language and also borrowed lexemes, as language contact has been an ongoing fact of life in South-Western Kurzeme. This region has been influenced by several languages – both neighbouring and more distant."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This article is focused on the analysis of surnames used in the eastern part of Latvia, i.e., Latgale, the history of which to a certain extent differs from other regions of Latvia. This is due to almost 300 years (1629–1917) of isolation from the territory inhabited by other ethnic Latvians, during which this region was under Polish and later Russian rule. During this 300-year-long separation, Latgale developed its own culture, a written tradition based on the local Latvian dialect, etc. The introduction of surnames for the Latvians of Latgale also differed from other regions. As Latgale is a multi-ethnic region, the system of surnames used there reflects not only the peculiarities of the local sub-dialects in vocabulary and semantics, but also contacts with other languages – Lithuanian, Estonian, Polish, Russian, Belarusian. This article is based on research results acquired within the framework of the project “Latvian surnames in archival materials. Latgale” directed by the Latvian Language Agency. Its main objective was to systematise Latgalian surnames registered in the 1935 census. The research data were summarised in a book “Latvian surnames in archival materials. Latgale”, compiled by historian Ilmārs Mežs. This book comprises about 4000 Latvian surnames from Latgale. Each surname is provided with statistical information and a description of its historical place of origin (sometimes even a particular village). Whenever possible, one or several versions of the meaning of each surname are given."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Any scholarly description of Hungarian dialects may only be possible for the time period after the settlement of the Hungarian-speaking population in the Carpathian Basin. Research in historical dialectology has primarily focused on the phonological characterization of 11th-14th century conditions, while in terms of sources, scholars have so far relied primarily on early data related to tribes’ names, historical data recorded in charters, today’s dialects, as well as evidence provided by related languages and elements borrowed from others. My paper sets out to establish the value of various sources in historical dialectology in view of our current knowledge in language history and calls attention to related methodological pitfalls. As most of these source types may also greatly contribute to the better understanding of the history of other languages, these methodological issues are relevant not only for Hungarian historical linguistics and dialectology but also more generally.

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Significant studies on the sound systems of Edoid languages have been conducted, but studies of the internal relations that may exist within them are rare. Linguistic and nonlinguistic correlates of Northern Edoid features have been identified, thereby laying out broad phonetic and phonological indices for identifying this group of languages. Esan is classified as North Central Edoid. The goal of this study is to address the need to further define internal linguistic relations within the languages which constitute this linguistic group. Specifically, this study seeks to identify an order of historical emergence of identified Esan speech varieties. The study is lexicon based. Data were gathered from one adult native speaker from each of the twelve identified Esan speech varieties making a total of twelve informants. The Ibadan word list of 400 basic items served as an instrument. Available data were transcribed in phonetic tradition and subjected to sound identification procedures. A comparative analysis of the sound systems which emerged for each identified Esan speech variety, separated them into eight groups in the following order: Udo-Ugboha-Ubiaza; Ebhoato-Igueben-Ilushi; Uromi; Ekpoma; Ohordua; Ogwa; Irrua; Ugbegun. The first group of Esan speech varieties exhibit speech sound characteristics that indicate that it is an earlier form of the language. Ubiaza exhibited further linguistic indices to suggest that it predates its counterpart Esan varieties. Although this study is not aimed at reconstructing Esan, its findings serve as input to such a goal as well as to dialect studies of the language. It provided an avenue for the documentation of Esan speech forms. The outcome of this study contributes to further similar linguistic studies on Esan and other Edoid Languages."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The following article strives to present a project that was launched by language enthusiasts in an attempt to revive Norn, a Scandinavian language that used to be spoken on the Northern Isles but died out about 200 years ago. On that account, the reasons and mechanics of language endangerment and language death are examined in this paper as well as different approaches to language revival or revitalization. The importance of language as a means of preserving one’s identity is only one of the reasons why these kinds of projects deserve more attention than they have gotten so far. Although Norn is classified as a Trümmersprache , which means that not a lot is known about it, a lot of works have been published about it. As a topic, it is far from being exhausted. The Nynorn project , however, is a relatively new attempt that hasn’t been covered by scientific research yet. The aim of this paper is to provide insight into the work of the Nynorn community that tries to reconstruct a version of Norn that people will be able to speak one day."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The Baltic languages remain of special interest for linguists because they contain many archaic features essential for the comparative research of Indo-European languages and reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European (Mikić 2014: 39). The Lithuanian prosodic system is characterized by free accent and two types of syllable accents (or tones) in the long stressed syllables. The stress is inherited from Indo-European and can fall on any syllable of a word, i. e. last, penultimate, antepenultimate etc. (Stundžia 2014: 12). In the Northern Aukštaitian dialect of Panevėžys of the Lithuanian Language, four types of syllable accents are possible in the long stressed syllables (more clearly heard in the diphthongs, less in the monophthongs): acute, circumflex, neoacute, neocircumflex (Garšva 1982: 65 ff.). These accents are positional allotones of two types of syllable accents: acute and circumflex. Two more types of accents are possible in strong syllables consisting of two central sounds: typical and atypical. Typical acute and circumflex accents are characteristic of verbs of non-iterative action and of “barytone” denominative words, atypical accents, with an emphasis on the second part of the stressed component, are characteristic of verbs of iterative action and of “oxytonic” denominative words (Kačiuškienė 2009: 34). The article focuses on results of the auditory and instrumental experiment and demonstrates different auditory and acoustic properties of the secondary types of pitch accents of the Northern Aukštaitian Dialect of Panevėžys of the Lithuanian Language."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The Celts are commonly regarded as one of the Indo-European ethnolinguistic groups, speaking Celtic languages derived from Proto-Celtic. Numerous archaeobotanical, palaeogenetic and historical linguistic analyses demonstrate that the most ancient European pulse crops, such as chickpea (Cicer arietinum), grass pea (Lathyrus sativus), lentil (Lens culinaris), lupins (Lupinus spp.), pea (Pisum sativum), vetches (Vicia spp.) and faba bean (Vicia faba), were widely used in everyday life as early as sixth millennium BC. The Latin word denoting ‘pea’, pisum, was borrowed by both Brythonic and Goidelic languages, spoken during the first centuries AD in Britain and Ireland, and produced the words denoting ‘pea’ in their modern members. The ultimate origin of the words denoting ‘faba bean’ in all living and attested Celtic languages is the Proto-Indo-European root *bhabh-, denoting the same crop, literally meaning something swollen and imported from both the Latin faba and the Old Norse baun. The majority of the words denoting ‘grain’ in the Celtic languages are descendants of the Proto-Celtic root *grāno, denoting ‘grain’ and originating from the Proto-Indo-European *g'er[a]n-, *grān-, denoting ‘grain’ and ‘corn’."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The words denoting the most ancient European grain legumes, such as ‘pea’, ‘lentil’ or ‘faba bean’, in both extinct and living Baltic languages confirm that these crops were cultivated among the ancestors of the modern Lithuanians and Latvians. The words denoting ‘pea’, such as Lithuanian žirnis and Latvian zirņi, are derived from the Proto-Baltic *žir̂n-ia- and the Proto-Indo-European *g'er[a]n-, denoting grain. The Proto-Indo-European root denoting ‘lentil’, *lent-, gave the Proto-Baltic *leñšia- and the modern Lithuanian lęšis and the Latvian lēca. The linguistic evidence confirms that the Old Balts transferred both grain legume crops and their names to their Finno-Ugric neighbours."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"In the present study, I argue that post-posed topic specification (PTS) across the Sahara is an areal phenomenon and that in the case of Southern Tamazight (i.e., Tuareg &amp; Zenaga) it is an innovation generated by pattern replication. On the other hand, the required matter for PTS formation in Southern Tamazight is generally provided by Tamazight itself by means of system-internal developments involving the following predominant grammaticalisation track, that is, [*modality markers &gt; topic specifiers]. I also show that full convergence has taken place in these Southern Tamazight languages, which has affected their linguistic typology on the morphological, syntactic, and pragmatic level. Moreover, the study accounts for the significance of the functional parameter of contrast in the development of these topic specifiers and hence confirms the importance of system-based factors in language change."

Changes in many regions are shown by glottograms that simultaneously show regional and generational differences. The usage of kinship terms in Japanese shows interesting sociolinguistic features. It is linked to the consciousness of attribution to a specific social class. Due to the agricultural land reform after the war, the difference in social hierarchy within the rural areas became smaller, but the distinction or disparity made by kinship terms remained. Although the agricultural land reform was carried out all over the country at the same time, the standard form o-too-san for “father” gradually spread throughout the country in the latter half of the 20th century. The diffusion pattern is similar to other standard forms. From the above, it can be concluded that the standard form otoo-san was not directly influenced by changes in social stratification, but was the spread of standard language only in words without social-class background. The ultimate mechanism of change was found to be the “law of respect reduction”."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"A discourse is considered coherent only if all its parts are semantically related to each other and if it makes sense. However, coherence cannot be attributed to a discourse in advance because it depends on how the participants understand what they hear/ read. So we can say that it is not the discourse that establishes coherence, but the participants according to their understanding of a discourse. In practise, this means that for the same discourse there are at least two coherences that may or may not match up. Usually they match up to some extent because participants follow the cooperative principle of mutual willingness to establish coherence in discourse. There are several strategies for establishing and maintaining discourse coherence; among them, repetition and inference form an extensive group. In this paper, however, I will focus only on the strategies that are typical of spontaneous spoken discourse. These are the following: questions, completion, contradiction and polyphonic talk. In the second part of the article I will present each of them in the examples of spontaneous dialectal discourse. The texts were recorded in Brda, a region in the far west of Slovenia. The dialect spoken there is called the Brda dialect. It belongs to the Littoral dialect group of the Slovene language."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Historia medicinal (1565–1574) is an educational work that sought to promote knowledge of American phytotherapy for academic and economic purposes. This educational aim was accomplished after its publishing success in Spain and other European countries. Our objective is to examine the American words Nicolas Monardes chose and assess the degree of penetration of Native American loanwords and Americanised hispanicisms which have become fully incorporated into current American Spanish. The degree of penetration is measured through the variables with which they appear in the text (loanwords, number of appearances with or without explanation, used in medicine, medical term). 93 words were analysed using quantitative methodology and different degrees of penetration were detected. These terms included Native American loanwords, mediaeval medical hispanicisms, Spanish words created to describe American reality and neologisms that were widespread in the 16th century."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The linguistic description of the dialect of Vyšneve (Černihiv, Ukraine) can be considered a milestone of a more comprehensive dialectal and sociolinguistic study on the dialects spoken along the Ukrainian-Belarusian and, to a lesser extent, Russian border areas of eastern Polissia. Some of the most representative features of the Vyšneve dialect and its relation to Belarusian have already been the object of previous linguistic analysis. The village is situated about 35 km north-east of the city of Černihiv (regional centre); 12 km south-east of the town of Ripky (former district centre). The distance to the Belarusian border is approximately 35 kilometers. Only the former district of Horodjans’k separates Vyšneve from the region of Brjansk (Russian Federation). The factual material examined in this article aims to complete previous research gaps and, at the same time, intends to foster further theoretical reflections about the origin of these border dialects. The analysis of this local dialect (which includes the phonetic-phonological, morpho-syntactic and lexical levels) in fact lays the foundation for successive and more advanced stages of research on the Ukrainian-Belarusian-Russian border dialects. In this contribution the dialectal features will be systematically compared with both the neighbouring Belarusian dialects spoken along the Ukrainian-Belarusian continuum and with the nearby southern Russian dialects, particularly with their western group. The latter, in fact, shares with the neighbouring Ukrainian and Belarusian border dialects a series of isoglosses and idiosyncratic traits."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"In this article, I present phonological and morphological features of three Aromanian subdialects in the Republic of Macedonia. The study is based on fieldwork recordings of Aromanian dialect speakers from urban and rural communities: Struga, Cruşova, and Beala di Supra. In describing these features, this article raises the general descriptive question of how far Aromanian is a Romance language preserved in a Balkan environment."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"In this paper I have attempted to classify and explain 30 words and phrases representative of language medley in Northern France. They illustrate a mixture of Germanic and Romance languages: Flemish in French and Picard, French in Flemish, Picard in French and vice versa. I will discuss imagination, word-play and lexical creativity in code-switching situations, as well as the dynamics of regional variation in the epilinguistic data under consideration."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This article presents the linguistic analysis of a humorous program broadcast on the Maribor commercial radio station Radio City. The program is deliberately recorded in the Maribor colloquial language variety and as such reflects the diversification of media language. The aim of our present research is to confirm the stratification of media speech as a manifestation of the need for identification with the speech of the environment, i.e. the intended public, and at the same time point out the need of public speech as a national language for the achievement and reflection of a collective identity. We believe that in the realization of the multilingual strategy in the integrational and globalizational processes in Europe, the preservation of such linguistic and cultural diversity should present a source of strength rather than a weakness."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Dialect variation is perceived and encoded in everyday language situations. Studies in the field of folk linguistic enquiry which has come to be known as perceptual dialectology, pioneered in the 1980s by scholars such as Dennis Preston, showed that beliefs nonlinguists have about language variation can play a critical role in language maintenance and change. This paper is an attempt to rethink the issue of accent identification from the perspective of perceptual dialectology by discussing the methodological hurdles to overcome when assessing folk perception of dialects. Illustration comes from two recent studies tackling the perception of geolinguistics variation in Eastern Canada. A comparison of the most common data collection techniques such as mental mapping, dialect identification tests requiring informants to listen to voices of different degrees of dialect markedness and dialect questionnaires raises several issues that call for a diversification of research design including indirect attitude measurements, especially affective priming."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This paper continues an article devoted to the linguistic description of the local dialect of Vyšneve, cf. DiG 30 (2022), 23–49. The present study, as previously mentioned, completes a piece of a more comprehensive dialectal and sociolinguistic research on the dialects spoken along the Ukrainian-Belarusian and, to a minor extent, Russian borders. This is a territorial segment located in the eastern Polissian macro region and, more precisely, in the north-western part of the Region of Černihiv (Ukraine). In this continuation, the analysed material describes basic verbal morphology, the ways of expressing modality, the most evident syntactic and lexical features of this local dialect."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This paper has two chief goals: (i) to collate the disparate synchronic evidence for the distribution of ‘daughter’ and ‘son’ from the dialect maps available for the modern Celtic languages, namely: the Gaelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx) and Brittonic (Welsh, Cornish and Breton), (ii) to revisit and analyse the distribution of the terms ‘son’ and ‘daughter’ at an early stage of Continental Celtic from two millennia ago in Gaulish and Celt-Iberian with particular reference to the Indo-European lexemes * dʱug̑ʱh 2 ter ‘daughter’ and *suh x nú- ‘son’."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The study of dialectal microvariation in spoken Spanish faces challenges due to the absence of an adequate morpho-syntactically annotated and parsed corpus. Therefore, this article introduces a novel technique, a game-based approach, for creating resources for non-standard Spanish language varieties. The article provides an overview of the progress in designing three Games With A Purpose ( GWAPs ) prototypes, to wit , Agentes, Tesoros , and Anotatlón . These games aim to facilitate the confirmation and correction of the morpho-syntactic tagging task of the COSER-AP ( Corpus Oral y Sonoro del Español Rural-Anotado y Parseado , ‘Annotated and Parsed Audible Corpus of Spoken Rural Spanish’). First, the article presents the methodology used to build the games. Second, it offers a detailed description of the implemented Game Design Elements ( GDEs ). Finally, the article discusses the results of a pilot evaluation that assesses player enjoyment and the linguistic accuracy. Findings are promising, with Tesoros and Anotatlón demonstrating high levels of enjoyment. Additionally, Agentes proves to be effective in collecting a large number of annotations. The linguistic accuracy also shows potential benefits of gamified approaches in linguistic annotation tasks. However, it also emphasizes the importance of considering regional in player assessment and training them in multidialectal contexts."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This paper provides an overview of geographical variation of sibling term systems used in Asia and Africa, which are categorized based on distinctions of (1) relative age, (2) sex, and (3) relative sex. Experts in languages/language groups of Asia and Africa have analyzed and mapped these systems; using their findings, I created summative maps showing the geographical distributions of the system types based on rates (percentages) of each type. Type A (undifferentiated sibling type) is conspicuous in Africa. Type B (relative age type) is used in many languages in Africa and Southeast Asia. Type C (skewed age type) commands an absolute majority in languages of Northeast Asia and is also found in Southeast Asia. The change of Type A &gt; Type B &gt; Type C is inferred from these systems’ distributions. Type D (age/sex type) is the only type in Sinitic, and has affected neighboring languages. Type E (brother/sister type) holds the vast majority in Semitic and South Asian languages and has affected surrounding languages. Type F (relative sex type) and its variations are found in peripheral languages in Asia and Africa; this might be the oldest type. This interpretation is supported by attested changes in Japonic."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Spanish speakers use a great diversity of terms to refer to Pisum sativum , from the better known guisante and arveja , to other less common forms such as chícharo , bisalto , pésol , présules , pitos , titos , pedrolos , mánganos , garavanzos , fréjoles , etc. This work analyzes the great diversity of names that the species Pisum sativum receives in Spanish and it does it through the Spanish geolinguistic atlases and the lexicons of the cultured norms of the main cities of the Hispanic world. Through this analysis we will try to explain the reason for this diversity with the objective of understanding if this variety is due to a question of synonymy or to a confusion between species of legumes or between varieties within the Pisum species itself. We will explain that the history of the denominations of the pea, and of the legumes in general, is marked by its confusion from the beginnings of language; a confusion that comes motivated mainly by the similarity that possess all the species that conform the family Papilionoideae and that causes that the speakers confuse in many occasions some plants with others.."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This paper examines the evolution of aspectual formations in Insular Celtic. It is argued that the emergence of these formations and their unusual morphosyntactic structure have been determined by internal systemic factors. It is also suggested that the manner in which these formations developed is of importance for our understanding of the processes involved in the emergence of grammatical subsystems in general. It is demonstrated that the Celtic aspectual system evolves in a manner reminiscent of the concept of developmental stratification and, significantly, that it evolves in a remarkably coherent and ordered fashion. The inexorable and structured nature of this evolution would seem to provide evidence for the claim that there may exist within languages a certain teleological impulse; in other words, that rather than being simply random, language change is in some fundamental and meaningful sense goal-directed."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This paper deals with the language used in Latvian settlements in Siberia. It is based on the author's observations and on data gathered during three ethnolinguistic expeditions to Lejas Bulana, in the Krasnoyarsk District, in 1991 and 2004, as well as to Timofejevka, in the Novosibirsk District, in 2006. An analysis was carried out to assess the extent of the Latvian language in these areas, which are separated from their ethnic territory. The study focussed on the language skills of different generations, depending on their education, religious identity and amount of communication with Latvia. The situation is better in Lejas Bulana, where in recent years teachers have been coming from Latvia. However, this community is losing its young generation to big cities, where their exposure to Latvian culture is lost, and thus little by little they begin to forget the Latvian language"
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This article discusses a type of prepositional construction that is highly characteristic for a group of East Franconian dialects, located in the south-eastern part of Germany. The construction expresses local relations and contrasts with the standard German construction as well as with the regional standard of this area. Based on spontaneous spoken dialect material, the article reveals an ongoing process of change: among young adults today not only the standard variant but also occasional hybrid formations are used as replacements for the original, the latter functioning as membership-markers to this dialectal community."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The argument put forward in the present article is that many Polish dialectal plant names do not have folk roots. The only way to ascertain the true origin of a given name is by analysing the history of the dialectal name and related names in other languages. Such an analysis leads to the conclusion that Polish dialectal names have various origins. Some of them are truly dialectal, i.e. they originate from Polish dialects, while others are colloquial, non-dialectal native names that have been adapted by particular dialects. Yet others are relatively new loanwords and new calques, while another group originates from Old Polish forms no longer in use in non-dialectal Polish. The latter do not comprise a homogeneous category. Instead, they fall into three subcategories: Polish names originating from the Polish language or inherited from Old Slavic, old loanwords employed in Old Polish and no longer in use today except in Polish dialects, and finally, an often misclassified group of names comprising old calques. In the summary of the present study the author emphasises the importance of a diachronic and comparative approach to analysing dialectal plant names. She highlights the existence of numerous calques, especially old ones, whose presence had previously been overlooked due to their native and sometimes almost entirely dialectal character. Therefore, a superficial, synchronic analysis would not reveal their long and rich history or the fact that they also have counterparts in non-Slavic languages, indeed often have ancient roots."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The article presents the research findings on the use of various social varieties of the Slovenian language, i. e. Standard and Non–standard language, by the students studying Slovenian language and literature in Maribor. A brief introduction is followed by a description of language culture and its efforts to improve the subject matter and the importance of the norm in a language with rich social language varieties use. The research indicates the largely positive attitude of young people to the use of their own dialect in different language situations thus shifting the society’s traditionally negative attitude towards the use of dialectal language, perceiving it as a value and as an indicator of one’s personal and national identity. General dialectal characteristics are distinguished in non-formal communication and the informants' switching between the Standard language and the dialect in non-formal communication is a rare occurance, showing that the environment of schooling and the field of study are not prevailing influence factors in choosing a specific social language variety."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The comitative represents a particular case in the Romance languages of the Iberian Peninsula. Except for Catalan, the rest of varieties possess a redundant form inherited from the evolution of the Latin postposition plus the preposition con (‘with’). However, some authors point out a tendency that favours subject forms or even stressed object forms in persons in which the norm prohibits them. With the aim of finding the vernacular responses to this respect, this paper attempts to account for all the possibilities in the comitative in the Romance languages of the Iberian Peninsula as well as the factors upon which the selection of either strategy depends."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Summary Languages and dialects can change from one prosodic category to another, causing thereby phonetic and phonological changes. This happened in Danish as well as in Northern Alemannic when both changed their basic rhythm from a more syllable-based system to a more word-based one. The consequences of this transition were very similar, some even identical. This article focuses on these similarities comparing the development of the plosive sounds as well as the assimilation of nd &gt; n in Danish and in a small area of Northern Alemannic in the transition area to Rhenish Franconian. Furthermore some of the changes that have taken place in a wider area of Northern Alemannic are discussed such as the deletion of word final vowels (apocope), the introduction of the glottal stop, the linking n in hiatus position as well as phonetic assimilation across word boundaries."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This article is a synthesis of the major elements of a sociolinguistic theory presented by Jean Le Dû and Yves Le Berre in their recent book, Métamorphoses, Trente ans de sociolinguistique à Brest (1984–2014) . Given that both authors come from native Breton-speaking families in Western Brittany and have experienced the language shift to French first-hand, they provide a unique, inside view of the process as well as the reasons Breton speakers opted in favour of French. The sociolinguistic concepts they have imagined provide highly useful tools that highlight the inseparable bond between language and the social, political and economic forces that govern our choices. More specifically, they point out that the “Breton language” is splintered into as many varieties as there are social and geographic entities in western Brittany. For this reason, it should not be viewed as a monolithic entity. Far from “reviving” or “saving” the language, the authors argue that the recent creation of a phonologically, grammatically and lexically unified Breton norm is often so distant from the vernacular language that it has provoked a new form of diglossia which failed to reverse the break in the transmission of the natural language. The book provides tremendous insight into the complex issues which lead people to shift to another language. Language planners and scholars working on similar endangered language situations and who want to understand the mechanisms at work (and thus hopefully have some success in their endeavours) would do well to take heed of their experience."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This article is concerned with basic intonational features of Sicilian, a Romance variety spoken in Sicily in Southern Italy. While there has been some research on the intonational features of the regional variety of Italian, Sicilian intonation remains undescribed. The first part of the article provides a historic overview of the dialectal configuration of Sicilian and the Sicilian-Italian diglossia. In the subsequent section we perform an intonational analysis on a Sicilian corpus containing acoustic data of 432 utterances (216 broad focus statements and 216 information-seeking yes-no questions). Once the basic intonational features of Sicilian are described and analyzed we use the informatic tool ProDis (Elvira-García et al. 2018) for a quantitative cluster analysis in order to define geoprosodic groups within Siciliy. Finally, we carry out another cluster analysis with the aim of modelling prosodic distances between Romance varieties spoken in different areas in Italy."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"As the second part of a general study about semantic determinism, this article continues to analyze the topographic lexicon of Gallo-Romance dialects. The new concepts (‘river’, ‘brook’, ‘valley’, ‘cave’) that I examine in this paper complete my previous survey about the designations of hills and mountains. Most of all, the new set of data allows me to go beyond isolated concepts and to present for the first time the motivational synthesis of a whole theme. The result is that, whatever the concept, words referring to topography are generally created according to four matrices of designation: such words originally allude to (1) level; (2) concavity/convexity; (3) physical composition; or stem from a (4) conceptual confusion due to adjacency. The method that reduces hundreds of lexical forms to a handful of creative patterns leads to a direct perception of how the lexicon is structured and has a strong heuristic potential."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This study examines the ability to identify different Chinese dialects through the English language and evaluates how often respondents pay attention to phonological features and rate of speech to explain their categorizations. The research includes 100 Chinese undergraduate students and 100 young people without advanced degrees aged 20 to 25. Discrete independent data samples collected during the interview of participants are analyzed with the help of such statistical methods as Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Wilcoxon's test. The obtained results indirectly show the ability of respondents to identify native and non-native English speakers around the world, as well as determine their nationality. The outcomes of the paper explicate who, in general, categorize Chinese dialects better and which dialects are the most recognizable. Research data reveal a high degree of stereotypization of various dialects, especially the Beijing and U dialects. Moreover, based on the data obtained, it can be concluded that speaking rate significantly affects the perception and classification of a speaker from a particular province of China."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Linguists of historical English, of traditional dialects and present-day varieties of English, generally rely on written texts, now often available in the form of corpora. However, the historical development of English, including its regional dialects, was naturally rooted in the spoken vernacular, rather than the literary standard. This paper, based on EDD Online (3.0), therefore, argues that the wealth of sources as used by Wright in his comprehensive English Dialect Dictionary ( EDD ) should no longer be disregarded, given that no better information is available. After a critical assessment of the widespread scepticism towards the EDD sources and of the different motivation of scholars not primarily concerned with traditional dialects (such as OED lexicographers), the paper first provides a survey of the different types of sources used by the EDD and presented in different lists and tables in EDD Online, and then focuses on the unpublished sources. The subsequent section shows that part of the problem of spoken sources results from the unjustified insistence of many scholars on phonetics to be the level of linguistic interest. In answer to the OED’s scepticism towards Wright’s sources as expressed in a paper by Durkin (2010a), the final section provides an analysis of Northamptonshire dialect words as a test case, with various linguistic issues beyond the OED’s focus on the temporal frame of reference."

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Latvian and Lithuanian share a large number of related lexical items in their standard varieties, but even more so in their dialects. Even though the traditional regional dialects are relatively well-preserved both in Latvia and Lithuania, nowadays they are disappearing. For this reason, a project called Atlas of the Baltic languages was initiated in 2006, with the aim to study both Baltic languages from a geolinguistic point of view. Altogether, five volumes are planned for the Atlas of the Baltic Languages , presenting the dialectal vocabulary in thematic groups: flora-related vocabulary; fauna-related vocabulary; human physical qualities and kinship terminology; housing and settlement; natural phenomena, time, weather, etc. The selection of the lexical items for the Atlas of the Baltic Languages is based not only on words of common origin in Latvian and Lithuanian, but also on related semantics, therefore all volumes will include semantic maps as well."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"A number of surname-based studies have presented a relationship between medieval regional dialect lexis and the distribution of associated modern-day surnames. However, by carrying out localised research, it appears that the two might not be so closely linked as previously thought, with discrepancies in the distribution of regionally specific names and equivalent occupational descriptions. As a result, there seems to be a need to reconsider the connection between regional lexicons and corresponding name stocks, which may have been less closely related, at a period of non-hereditary by-naming, than current knowledge suggests."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This study attempts a close investigation of areal variation in the major phonological features of the Egyptian Arabic spoken in the agrarian northern region of Kafrelsheikh (KEA): their contexts and patterns. Targeting old, rural speech, a survey of all the localities is conducted through recordings of natural speech and a questionnaire. The instrumentally investigated phonological variables in KEA include major allophonic variants, and some typical instances of assimilation, dissimilation, metathesis, sound addition and sound deletion. Most instances of variation in the present data prove to be linguistically conditioned. Analysis shows that the differences between the dialect areas do not involve all the previous variants. KEA roughly seems to have five speech areas, with each enjoying intra-variation and comprising many relic features. Finally, the findings are interpreted with reference to the phonological system of (Egyptian) Arabic as a whole and various models of language variation patterning."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"In 1965, I recorded some conversations in the Picard dialect of Aubers, a village located in northern France. I used hearing tests to extract a corpus of 70 words containing diphthongs. The speakers I considered to be representative were born respectively in 1885, 1898 and 1902. Their diphthongs are different from those of traditional Picard speakers and affect both dialect and common French words. A spectrographic analysis allowed me to single out three types of phenomena in the corpus: the vocalization of semi-consonant, the development of an epenthetic vowel before and after a stressed vowel. Various stages of phonetic evolution have thus been stressed, appearing in several points of my Picard Linguistic Atlas maps, insertion of a vocalic element before some accented vowels, lengthening of “epenthetic” vowels, prominence shift from the second to the first accented element of a syllable, as well as the loosening and loss of the second part of a diphthong. These phenomena affect both standard French and Picard words. The vocalic system of the Aubers dialect as spoken in 1900, as revealed by a spectrographic analysis, has no equivalent in the Picardy area."

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"In the Fertile Crescent, grain legumes such as peas, lentils and faba beans were domesticated at about the same time as wheat and barley. In most branches of the Uralic language family, the words for pea have common roots, with the exception of the borrowings in the Finnic and Para-Finnic groups from Baltic and in Hungarian from Turkic. These results suggest that the pea may be an ancient crop among the Uralic peoples, with those who migrated losing the original Uralic word for it and borrowing it later from the non-Uralic peoples. Alternatively, the pea may have arrived after the Hungarian and Finnic peoples had migrated from the Uralic homeland. Moreover, words for lentil are clearly borrowed from neighbouring cultures, while words for faba bean are either derived from those for pea or borrowed from other cultures, demonstrating they were not among the first crops to be used by any of the Uralic peoples."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This article discusses the structure and state of the German language spoken today by the descendants of German immigrants to Russia in the 18th century. The (socio-) linguistic argumentation permits the following conclusion: The language based on German (Russlanddeutsch) may be a variety of the German language (russisches Deutsch) or a variety of the Russian language (deutsches Russisch), but it is the speakers in Russia who have the last word on this question. How they regard the language depends on their sense of identity, whether they feel Russian or German. Thus, future research into the linguistic situation of this group will best be served by an interdisciplinary approach and the a co-operation of linguists, psychologists, and historians."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Welsh English and the Celtic Englishes in general are known for their preference for rising tones in declaratives. However, the statement that Welsh English has a preference for rising tones is insufficient to explain its main prosodic characteristics. The present investigation focuses on Ceredigion, a county in West Wales with a relatively high percentage of native Welsh speakers. Several excerpts have been collected from the interviews taken for the Survey of Anglo-Welsh Dialects (1977‒1979) and processed through Praat with the aim of identifying and analysing prosodic features of Ceredigion English. For the analysis, three fundamental elements will be considered: alignment of the stressed syllable, characteristics of the upward movement, and pitch peak. Through this detailed prosodic characterization of Ceredigion English, it will be shown that prosody is a distinguishing feature of Welsh English accent."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Supporters of the existence of the Altaic language family consider it to include Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Korean and Japonic branches, and believe that all of these originated from the Proto-Altaic. On the basis of archaeological findings, one may expect that traditional Eurasian pulse crops, such as peas ( Pisum sativum ), lentils ( Lens culinaris ), chickpeas ( Cicer arietinum ), faba beans ( Vicia faba ), vetchlings ( Lathyrus spp.) and vetches ( Vicia spp.), were known to the ancestors of the modern Altaic nations. This assumption is confirmed by two Proto- Altaic roots. The first root is * bŭkrV , denoting pea. Its three main direct derivatives preserved the original meaning and transferred it to their modern descendants, namely the Proto-Turkic * burčak to the majority of modern Turkic languages, such as Kazakh with burşaq ; the Proto-Mongolic * buγurčag , giving the modern Mongolian būrcag ; and the Proto-Tungusic * boKa-ri , giving the Manchu boxori . Another root is * zịăbsa , denoting lentil. It gave the Proto-Turkic * jasimuk , the Proto-Mongolic * sisi and the Proto-Tungusic * sibsV . In Turkic and Tungusic, its original meaning was preserved, such as in the Turkmen jasmiq or the Nanai siusi , while in Mongolic it shifted to Sorghum spp., such as in Kalmyk, with šiš."

The paper also draws a comparison with earlier syntheses of these phenomena in Slovene."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The paper examines the semantic change, i.e. subjectification of place deictic elements in German dialects. Starting from a description of (dialectal) language change, the theory of area progression is applied to two case-studies of subjectification: on the one hand, it is to be demonstrated that speakers tend to neutralize the (dynamic) perspectives ‹turned towards the speaker› and ‹turned away from the speaker› by generalizing formations with her - (and thus abolishing formations with hin -) in the northern (and increasingly in the southern) part of the research area. On the other hand, the static dimensions of distance hier vs. da/dort are increasingly neutralized in favour of dort/da in a large area of the respective western German dialects. Both processes will be subsequently explained with the speaker's striving for subjectification which, in the first case, manifests itself directly in the greater emphasis on the speaker's origo, whereas objects being in the speaker's field of vision constitute the basis for the direction of the neutrallization in the latter case. The origo is thus emphasized indirectly. Finally, the data will be taken to develop a theory of dialectal language change based on distributional generalizations."

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"A language is one of the most important indexes of ethnical awareness of Latvian Lithuanians. Societal functions of the Lithuanian language as the one of the ethnical minority in Latvia are narrowed – this language serves only for everyday communication because a possibility to use one's mother tongue in a different language environment is linked more with individual or family needs and those of a small circle of friends (more rarely, for the needs of community activities, in case if Lithuanians of a certain locality join associations). Thus, among Latvian Lithuanians, a spoken language is more common. The linguistic peculiarities of Lithuanians living in Latvia have been mostly investigated on the lexis level until now. However, a great variety of prepositional constructions is noticeable as well in the mother tongue of Lithuanians. According to their expression, the three-fold usage can be singled out: as in the Lithuanian literary language; as in a spoken language or dialects; and as in the language impacted by the Latvian language (or undergoing its additional impact). Such changes of the native Lithuanian language have occurred in the environment of the foreign language due to different reasons. The Latvian language has made and still makes a great influence; also, some constructions peculiar to the spoken Lithuanian language are present, too."

The results show substantial intergenerational variation in terms of the immigrants’ language use and language attitudes and point in the direction of a relatively rapid shift from Slovene to English, but not to the weakening of their sense of ethnic identity. The focus then shifts to the linguistic aspects of Slovene-English language contact themselves. In addition to interference phenomena in the immigrants’ language such as borrowing from English and Slovene-English code switching, special attention is paid to the presence of dialect or standard features in their mother tongue. Lexis in particular is interesting as it shows traces of other languages. Next, we try to identify the most significant factors which affect the immigrants’ choice between Slovene and English in various contexts as well as their use of either dialect or standard in Slovene."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Western Peninsular Spanish possesses a type of causative construction in which an intransitive lexeme is used as transitive. Specifically, the verbs caer (‘to fall’), quedar (‘to stay’) and entrar (‘to enter) can induce a direct object in detriment of the standard verbs tirar (‘to throw’), dejar (‘to leave’) and meter (‘to put in’). This phenomenon (called lability) has not been investigated in depth for Spanish and, with this paper I attempt to pinpoint its current geographical extension as well as the semantic factors that favour the transitivisation of these verbs."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The semantics of German ‘touch’ verbs include corresponding motor concepts. These seem to result from experiences and learning from subjective bodily actions and interactions with the environment during language acquisition (cf. Bailey 1997). When we learn a new action word, we often do so embedded in a particular motor context (cf. Bailey et al. 1997; Bergen et al. 2004). In this pilot study, we investigate how the motor concepts of German hand-related ‘touch’-verb variants ([ an ] fassen , [ an ] greifen , [ an ] langen , cf. VWB: 38–39, 40, 42) – which are often considered to be true synonyms – are applied by speakers from Austria, Germany and Switzerland. The empirical study draws on research into cognitive semantics (Pulvermüller 2005; Steels &amp; Belpaeme 2005; Barsalou 2008; Evans 2009) and motor cognition (Bailey et al. 1997; Marocco et al. 2010) and aims at adding a variationist linguistic component to the existing research (cf. Fink in prep.). By use of a stimulus response experiment with 25 native speakers from the three countries, we will show a) that the three verb variants differ in terms of motor concepts and therefore are no true synonyms and b) that the motor concepts for each verb differ between speakers of German in Austria, Germany and Switzerland."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This study of Australian English in general and the language of letters from nineteenth century immigrants in particular developed from two different interests. The first was a personal interest in Aust ralia and its history, linguistic and social, the second an explorer’s fascination wit h a field he knows to be largely unknown territory. The letters and diaries that are preserved from 19 th century Australia show the gripping lives of convicts, the lonesome toil of farmers and the daily experiences of city dwellers. Apart from the personal and his torical interests that are connected with these testimonies, the language of the letters is also worthwhile studying. This is intended in the present analysis. The study of Australian English (AE) is still a rather neglecte d topic of linguistic research especially if it is compared with the work done on the American (AmE) and British (EngE) varieties of English. This sit uation has improved since the days of the pioneering works of Baker (1966), Mitchell and Delbridge but outside Australia there is virtually only a handful of studies to be found. Notable exceptions are the works of Dabke (1976), Gorlach (1991) and Leitner (1984, 1989, 1990). The first works on Australian English focused on the origin of a particular Australian pronunciation, the mixing of dialects and the vocabulary of settlers and convicts. But in the 1970s the interest in the historical study of Australian English declined rapidly and gave way t o studies of present-day usage with special attention devoted to the langua ge contact situation of Aborigines and immigrants, sociolinguistic variables"
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Abstract: The Terminology of Pottery in Prekmurje, Slovenia This article presents the terminology employed in the pottery of Prekmurje. The terms presented are related to the most important pottery activities: getting (digging) clay, shaping objects on a potter's wheel, firing them in the kiln, preparing the glaze, drying the products and selling them. These are all professionnal dialectal terms dating back centuries ago, the proof of which is provided by archeological finds and local geographical names. The development of pottery in Prekmurje – the flat agricultural region which lies along the Mura River in the extreme northeast of Slovenia, bordering on Austria and Hungary – was possible because of the rich quantities of suitable clay and the high demand for earthenware. In addition to weaving, pottery was among the most important trades in Prekmurje and in some villages the majority of the population was involved in it. Owing to the changed social circumstances, the technical revolution (new cooking technology), the changed way of life and work in the countryside, pottery in Prekmurje has almost died out today. With the gradual disappearance of this old trade we are also witnessing the disappearance of the related terminology. It is the purpose of this inventory of pottery terminology to prevent its falling into oblivion and at the same time provide a comparison of the terms used in different Slovene dialectal areas. In this way we can define the location of individual lexemes used as well as their semantic fields. The terms collected, which are primarily of Slovene origin, although some have also been borrowed in different time periods from Hungarian and from/through German as contact languages, are mostly known only by the oldest generation of speakers."

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Abstract: A study of the semantic field ‘cow’ in Galician: ‘neck’ This article presents a sample of a broader project that has as objective its study of the names referring to the cow's appearance and certain parts of the body. I have chosen thirty lexical fields which best exemplify the different procedures that speakers follow for coining these names, and in this article I will focus on the words used to designate a cow's neck. The responses for this concept have been extracted from the materials of the Atlas Lingüístico Galego (165) and from a series of dialectal inquiries (216) carried out in 1969 by undergraduate students. A bipartite structure has been chosen for this work. In the first place, I analyze the geographic distribution of different responses in the case of this concept, categorizing each according to motive and registering these on a map. In the second place, each form is studied on an individual basis from several perspectives: etymology, morphological analysis, first recorded usage, for example. This methodology seeks to complement current work on the Atlas Lingüístico Galego and similar projects that focus on geolinguistic distribution without paying attention to the other aspects aforementioned. Eleven different lexical families (with some morphological variants) for ‘neck’ are commented on in this article. The most significant form noted is pescozo ; though colo is found and also xugueira , and, less commonly: cachazo, carrolo, gorxia, marmela, moleira, nobenillo, pulmoeira , and taloeira . Though there is not a great diversity of forms, they are, nevertheless very interesting, because we can observe a number of different linguistic and semantic developments. Whereas pescozo – the standard word for ‘neck’ and reflex of a Latin construction * cocciu ( cocciu ‘trough, sink’: the semantic link is clear, comparing a curved sink to the curvature of the neck) – is known throughout the whole territory, the other forms are each limited to a particular zone. We have descendants of Lat. collu ‘neck’, but only in the northern part of Galicia; as to the form caluga , Galician and Asturian dialectal data show that the etymological explanation suggested by Corominas is unacceptable, as this form must be connected to the family of reflexes of Lat. collu . We also find a term based on xugo ‘yoke’, a farming implement referring directly to the bovine's neck; xugueira is also a frequent appellation with reference to an ‘injured neck’. A southern form, cachazo , continues in the Portuguese linguistic domain, a term of disputed origin, possibly from cacho / a ‘mass of meat in a part of the body’. The etymology of carrolo is also undecided. Finally, there are a number of isolated responses and comments, each of which have been studied individually and compared to different data collected from dictionaries, databases, other dialectal research, etc. As a result of this, I have determined that: a) some forms are really references not to the neck but to a neighbouring part of the body: gorxia, moleira, marmela ; b) some constitute references to a disease that can affect the neck: nobenillo, pulmoeira ; and c) two forms remain that currently have not so far been satisfactorily explained: corpozo, taloeira . In the course of the article, I demonstrate the importance of dialectal data in refuting a number of etymological hypotheses and the usefulness of lexicographical material as an aid to improving our understanding of certain dialectal forms. The need to look at neighbouring linguistic zones in order to arrive at a better analysis of the data also emerges clearly from the work."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This paper presents the results of a preliminary study of documentation and description of Sammarinese, a peripheral variety of Romagnol spoken in the Republic of San Marino. Despite having been the country’s primary oral language for almost 1,000 years, Sammarinese is on the verge of extinction today as universal education and economic development have caused language shift to Italian beginning from the 1960s. A corpus of primary oral language data was collected from 17 informants in the form of semi-structured interviews with the goal of creating an archive of oral language histories in Sammarinese. These data, together with a corpus of vernacular and folkloric literature, served as the database for a descriptive analysis of some of the major phonological and morphosyntactic traits of the language. The results confirm Sammarinese’s status as a borderline Romagnol variety. However, the findings also reveal a language that stands apart from neighboring varieties due to complex historical and geographical factors, including a Celtic substratum from the pre-Roman and Roman times, a Byzantine Greek heritage and Lombard/ Germanic influence from the second half of the first millennium, and a geographic position that resulted in linguistic isolation from the vernaculars spoken in the Central Romagnol plain."

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The Northern Aukštaitian dialect of Panevėžys of the Lithuanian Language is interesting in synchronic, diachronic, typological, and ethnogenetic aspects; its idioms bear some witness to contacts of Lithuanian and Semigalian languages (Kačiuškienė 2009). The secondary types of pitch accents of the Northern Aukštaitian dialect of Panevėžys were discussed in Dialectologia et Geolinguistica 24 (Kačiuškienė 2016). The auditory and instrumental research proved that two secondary types of pitch accents contrast in the pure and mixed diphthongs of the forms of some dialectal verbs and denominative words in the Northern Aukštaitian dialect of Panevėžys of the Lithuanian Language. This is a distinctive opposition. It is possible that the opposition relates to Proto-Baltic accentuation paradigms. The secondary types of pitch accents have different acoustic properties. The most distinct are the quantitative characteristics of diphthongs and characteristics of the fundamental pitch. The detailed analysis of the prosodic system of the Northern Panevėžys dialect in the present article is based on the data of the author’s native dialect and the instrumental and auditory research (see (Kačiuškienė 2006)). The results of the research of the Northern Aukštaitian dialect of Panevėžys are important to the comparative and historical dialectology of the Baltic languages; they can be used in typological research and in the classroom as teaching materials."

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This study deals with a rarely discussed lexicological and semantic issue, Luxemburgish names of inns. I was astonished by their large number and their diversification. In the Middle Ages, many people could not read, therefore an inn was indicated by a sign, for instance that of a raven that gave it its name. The name of the inn could give its situation in the village in order to help foreigners to find their way, for instance “At the market”. I examine historical relations, too, like “way of the Romans” and, on the other hand, names of animals, such as “At the raven”. Last not least I have discovered funny names like “kitchen of the devil” and original names, for instance ”Why not?” or “The peppercorn”. I don’t neither forget a very old house name, “Plutoshaff”, founded in the eighteenth century by Franz Plutot, a personality of the village."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The purpose of this article is to analyze the semantic patterns according to which rises of land are referred to in the Romance dialects of France. Using the motivational method, I examine the etymology and the semantic field of more than 80 lexical types (found in dialect atlases) and their corresponding word families, going from pre-Latin to current language. If we look at their original meanings, it appears that the words that bear the sense ‘rise of land’ first referred to the shape or the rocky/bushy/earthy nature of hills and mountains, when they did not simply represent these as borders, heaps, projections or even as blows, as bumps. The main result of my research lies in the observation of semantic determinism. Any word that is related at one point of its history to the concept of ‘mountain’ is prone to develop (or to have developed) many – if not all – of the meanings listed above. This points out the highly probable existence of semantic laws that bind together sets of correlated notions. Using my results, I attempt to describe the global organization of meaning and its cyclical nature."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This paper treats linguistic changes over a long time span, covering 100 years in terms of the birth years of the informants and over 250 years since the compilation of a dialect glossary. Data from seven generations about 20 years apart were acquired. We compare the absolute time of linguistic change in lexical items recorded in Hamaogi, a dialect glossary, with the results of a large-scale sociolinguistic survey in Tsuruoka City. For lexical phenomena, the change seems to be continuous over the 250 years. Lexical changes occurred in the feudal ages, after modernization, after WWII and even recently. New dialect is discussed as a symbol of language change in the opposite direction to language standardization. A “glottogram map” or “3D glottogram” presents concrete data of the spatial diffusion of the new dialect form, ganpo. We offer concrete observations of the development of new dialect, which is part of a language change in progress. More than 250 years seem to be necessary from the beginning to the end of a lexical change. This suggests that many dialect forms will remain until the 22nd century.."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"By combining qualitative (synchronic and diachronic) and quantitative (algorithmic) approaches, this study examines the nature, structure, and dynamics of the linguistic variation attested in Berber of the Rif area (North, Northwest, and Northeast Morocco). Based on a cross-level corpus of data obtained from the Atlas linguistique des varieties berbères du Rif (Lafkioui 2007) and from numerous linguistic, sociolinguistic, and ethnographic fieldwork investigations in the area since 1992, this study shows that these Berber varieties form a language continuum with the following five stable core aggregates, which cut across administrative and political borders: Western Rif Berber, West-Central Rif Berber, Central Rif Berber, East-Central Rif Berber, and Eastern Rif Berber. Furthermore, data mining studies made it possible to objectively identify the principal aggregate discriminators of the Rif Berber continuum, which are dealt with in the study. A special focus in the article is put on the interplay between system-internal and system-external parameters for the selection, diffusion, and transformation of variants in Rif Berber."

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"Every day, we are confronted with meteorology, the scientific study of the atmospheric phenomena and their variations. The purpose of this article is to analyze the meteorological events in three languages, Luxemburgish and two other official languages of Luxembourg, French and German. First, we make a detailed inventory of verbs and verbal phrases which we found. Next, they are explained and commented; while there are seventeen items in French and German, there are eighteen in Luxem-burgish; so, the meteorological experiences are organized rather homogeneously. Then we deal with the lexicological specifications. In French, we discover the lightness of the meteorological phenomenon; it is followed by examples of atmospheric disturbances, which exist in German and Luxemburgish, too. A special focus of the article is put on the presentation of metaphorical expressions. Finally, we put the question if two meteorological events can appear at the same time."

Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"This paper addresses variation and change in the realization of superlative constructions in the light of the evidence provided by Modern Greek dialectal variation as a window into the study of the organization of grammar. Dialectal data show that analyticity prevails in the realization of relative comparative constructions, while absolute ones seem to resist more persistently due to their high relevance with another morphological category, evaluative intensification. Our findings argue in favour of the strong interplay among all three processes, viewed as realizations of the conceptual category of gradation, accounted for in terms of a continuum. The proposed organization captures the strong interplay between intensification and absolute superlatives on the one hand, while relative and absolute superlative formations on the other. On a theoretical level, this account could contribute further to important issues such as the controversial status of comparison and evaluation in grammar, which may differ cross-linguistically, suggesting that a combined account of the three processes might prove more adequate."
Dialectologia et Geolinguistica,"The aim of this study was to analyze the innovations of the Basque in the Salazar Valley, which is located in northeastern Navarre, and compare them with those of the Continental Basque Country in order to try to obtain chronological and geolinguistic information on the innovations of the wide eastern Basque Country. To achieve my purpose, I drew upon descriptions of the Basque dialect spoken in the Salazar Valley. This study analyzed texts dating from the 16 th , 17 th , 18 th and 19 th centuries from the Continental Basque Country as well as samples from the last two centuries from the Navarrese Pyrenees. The data collected from this region were examined with regard to the behavior of the isoglosses within the Continental Basque Country in earlier stages. I examined innovations with particular attention to what geographical diffusion model they showed and how far they spread. In addition, I analyzed what isogloss boundaries are recurrent and what innovations were transferred from the Pyrenees toward Navarre. I found that the Basque spoken in Lower Navarre has undergone change that has spread toward Labourd. Regarding contact with other dialects, it shares features with Labourdin to the west, and with Souletin to the east. On the assumption that Lower Navarre and Labourd have recently converged, a future hypothesis to test would be whether Lower Navarre merged with Soule in earlier stages."

PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Traditionally, many researchers have supported a uniformitarian view whereby all languages are of roughly equal complexity, facilitated by internal trade-offs between complexity at different levels, such as morphology and syntax. The extent to which the speakers’ societies influence the trade-offs has not been well studied. In this paper, we focus on morphology and syntax, and report significant correlations between specific linguistic and societal features, in particular those relating to exoteric (open) vs. esoteric (close-knit) society types, characterizable in terms of population size, mobility, communication across distances, etc. We conduct an exhaustive quantitative analysis drawing upon WALS, D-Place, Ethnologue and Glottolog, finding some support for our hypothesis that languages spoken by exoteric societies tend towards more complex syntaxes, while languages spoken by esoteric societies tend towards more complex morphologies."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Increased geographical mobility prompts dialectologists to factor in survey participants’ exposure to linguistic variation in their research. Changing mobility patterns (e.g. longer-distance commuting; easier relocation to distant places for work, study or marriage) have caused linguistic connections to become much more diverse, potentially contributing to the acceleration of dialect change. In this methodological work we propose the Linguistic Mobility Index (LMI) to estimate long-term exposure to dialectal variation and thereby to provide a reference of “localness” about survey participants. Based on data about a survey participant’s linguistic biography, an LMI may comprise combinations of influential agents and environments, such as the dialects of parents and long-term partners, the places where participants have lived and worked, and the participants’ level of education. We encapsulate the linguistic effects of these agents based on linguistic differences, the intensity and importance of the relationship. We quantify the linguistic effects in three steps. 1) The linguistic effect of an agent is represented by a linguistic distance, 2) This linguistic distance is weighted based on the intensity of the participant’s exposure to the agent, and 3) Further weighted according to the relationship embodied by the agent. LMI is conceptualised and evaluated based on 500 speakers from 125 localities in the Swiss German Dialects Across Time and Space (SDATS) corpus, and guidance is provided for establishing LMI in other linguistic studies. For the assessment of LMI’s applicability to other studies, four LMI prototypes are constructed based on the SDATS corpus, employing different theoretical considerations and combinations of influential agents and environments to simulate the availability of biographical data in other studies. Using mixed-effects modelling, we evaluate the utility of the LMI prototypes as predictors of dialect change between historic and contemporary linguistic data of Swiss German. The LMI prototypes successfully show that higher exposure to dialectal variation contributes to more dialect change and that its effect is stronger than some sociodemographic variables that are often tested for affecting dialect change (e.g. sex and educational background)."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Film festivals are a key component in the global film industry in terms of trendsetting, publicity, trade, and collaboration. We present an unprecedented analysis of the international film festival circuit, which has so far remained relatively understudied quantitatively, partly due to the limited availability of suitable data sets. We use large-scale data from the Cinando platform of the Cannes Film Market, widely used by industry professionals. We explicitly model festival events as a global network connected by shared films and quantify festivals as aggregates of the metadata of their showcased films. Importantly, we argue against using simple count distributions for discrete labels such as language or production country, as such categories are typically not equidistant. Rather, we propose embedding them in continuous latent vector spaces. We demonstrate how these “festival embeddings” provide insight into changes in programmed content over time, predict festival connections, and can be used to measure diversity in film festival programming across various cultural, social, and geographical variables—which all constitute an aspect of public value creation by film festivals. Our results provide a novel mapping of the film festival circuit between 2009–2021 (616 festivals, 31,989 unique films), highlighting festival types that occupy specific niches, diverse series, and those that evolve over time. We also discuss how these quantitative findings fit into media studies and research on public value creation by cultural industries. With festivals occupying a central position in the film industry, investigations into the data they generate hold opportunities for researchers to better understand industry dynamics and cultural impact, and for organizers, policymakers, and industry actors to make more informed, data-driven decisions. We hope our proposed methodological approach to festival data paves way for more comprehensive film festival studies and large-scale quantitative cultural event analytics in general."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"In evolutionary studies of human populations based on the Y chromosome, the majority of Native Americans belong to the QM3 lineage. Therefore, to study the history of groups inhabiting northern South America, it is necessary to have a higher resolution of the tree. The objective of this work was to identify new SNPs of the QM3 lineage that would allow the evaluation of the phylogenetic relationships between Andean and Amazonian populations of Colombia. Sequences previously obtained from two Y chromosomes of Amazonian populations were used, from which 13 potential SNPs were selected and typed in 171 Amazonian samples from the Vaupés region and in 60 samples from the Pasto, Nasa, Embera, Arhuaco and Kogüi ethnic groups of the Andean region. In addition, the main SNPs/markers (L56, L54, M346, M848, Z780, CTS11780) defining autochthonous Q lineages were typed, along with others defined by different SNPs/markers as reported in the literature (CTS11357, SA05, Z19319, Z5915, and Z19384). It was found that all the new SNPs are present in the Amazonian samples and only 2 of them are shared with the Embera, Nasa and Pasto, but none with the Kogüi and Arhuaco from the northern Andes, in the Colombian Caribbean. Combining the 13 variants of the present study with 14 previously reported and using TMRCA, a new QM3 tree proposal is generated. This method makes it possible to increase the number of sublineages of QM3 with a higher resolution and to detect differences between the different populations of Vaupés in the Amazon, as in the case of the Kubeos and Pisamiras, the latter of which is in grave danger of extinction. These new sublineages are useful for microevolutionary studies of the Amerindian populations of South America."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"This study empirically examines how reported corporate misconducts affect the stock returns of US firms. As the reported misconducts are broadcasted in the newspaper outlets, the cumulative abnormal return (CAR) is -4.1%. Involvement in a reported corporate misconduct gets punished by market participants especially when the act of reported misconduct is blamed on the level of the corporation rather than in involvement of a specific individual, when reported misconducts take place in the home market, and when the linguistic tone used in the newspaper article is negative. Financial penalties imposed, firm size, leverage, revenue growth, and the level of firm foreign exposure are found to have significant impact on the returns during the period of observation. The results suggest that investors recognize the importance to penalize firms in the financial markets when firms act unethically."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"The Internet, since its inception, has been imagined as a technology that enables information to overcome barriers of language and geography. As a handful of social media platforms now dominate globally, removing most barriers of distribution; this has created unprecedented opportunities for content to gain worldwide traction, regardless of its country of origin. Yet historically with few exceptions, people generally consume content that is from or for their region. Has the Internet or social media really altered this trait? Analyzing the extent of similarities between a hundred countries’ web use patterns simultaneously across their most popular websites, and country specific trends from YouTube and Twitter respectively, we find that countries which share borders or where people speak the same languages have the most similar web use patterns. Global social media usage on both YouTube and Twitter is even more heterogeneous and driven to a larger extent by language and geography than global website traffic. Neither does high prevalence of English language speakers in the two countries, nor does one of them being the United States contributes substantially to web use similarity. Global web use remains highly regional. The technical affordances of the Internet alone are thus insufficient to render a cosmopolitan world."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Standardized cross-cultural databases of the arts are critical to a balanced scientific understanding of the performing arts, and their role in other domains of human society. This paper introduces the Global Jukebox as a resource for comparative and cross-cultural study of the performing arts and culture. The Global Jukebox adds an extensive and detailed global database of the performing arts that enlarges our understanding of human cultural diversity. Initially prototyped by Alan Lomax in the 1980s, its core is the Cantometrics dataset, encompassing standardized codings on 37 aspects of musical style for 5,776 traditional songs from 1,026 societies. The Cantometrics dataset has been cleaned and checked for reliability and accuracy, and includes a full coding guide with audio training examples (https://theglobaljukebox.org/?songsofearth). Also being released are seven additional datasets coding and describing instrumentation, conversation, popular music, vowel and consonant placement, breath management, social factors, and societies. For the first time, all digitized Global Jukebox data are being made available in open-access, downloadable format (https://github.com/theglobaljukebox), linked with streaming audio recordings (theglobaljukebox.org) to the maximum extent allowed while respecting copyright and the wishes of culture-bearers. The data are cross-indexed with the Database of Peoples, Languages, and Cultures (D-PLACE) to allow researchers to test hypotheses about worldwide coevolution of aesthetic patterns and traditions. As an example, we analyze the global relationship between song style and societal complexity, showing that they are robustly related, in contrast to previous critiques claiming that these proposed relationships were an artifact of autocorrelation (though causal mechanisms remain unresolved)."

Most studies are performed on large spatial scales associated with countries and regions, where language dynamics are often dominated by the effects of geographic and administrative borders. Extending to smaller, urban scales, however, allows visualization of spatial patterns of language use determined by social dynamics within the city, providing valuable information for a range of social topics from demographic studies to urban planning. So far, few studies have been made in this domain, due, in part, to the challenges in developing algorithms that accurately classify linguistic features. Here we extend urban-scale geographical analysis of language use beyond lexical meaning to include other sociolinguistic markers that identify language style, dialect and social groups. Some features, which have not been explored with social-media data on the urban scale, can be used to target a range of social phenomena. Our study focuses on Twitter use in Buenos Aires and our approach classifies tweets based on contrasting sets of tokens manually selected to target precise linguistic features. We perform statistical analyses of eleven categories of language use to quantify the presence of spatial patterns and the extent to which they are socially driven. We then perform the first comparative analysis assessing how the patterns and strength of social drivers vary with category. Finally, we derive plausible explanations for the patterns by comparing them with independently generated maps of geosocial context. Identifying these connections is a key aspect of the social-dynamics analysis which has so far received insufficient attention."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Geographic patterns of cultural variations are affected by how cultural traits are transmitted within and between populations. It has been argued that cultural traits are transmitted in different manners depending on their characteristics; for example, words for basic concepts are less liable to horizontal transmission between populations (i.e., borrowing) than other words. Here we examine the geographic variation of traditional songs in the Ryukyu Archipelago, southwestern islands of Japan, to explore cultural evolution of music with a focus on different social contexts in which songs are sung. Published scores of 1,342 traditional songs are coded using the CantoCore song classification scheme and distances between the songs are calculated from the codings. Neighbor-Net graphs of regions/islands are generated on the basis of the musical distances, and delta scores are obtained to examine the treelikeness of the networks. We also perform analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) to evaluate the extent of musical diversification among regions/islands. Our results suggest that horizontal transmission between populations has played a greater role in the formation of musical diversity than that of linguistic diversity in the Ryukyu Archipelago and that the social context in which songs are sung has an effect on how they are transmitted within and between populations. In addition, we compare the observed patterns of song diversity among regions/islands with those of lexical and mitochondrial-DNA (mtDNA) diversity, showing that the variation of songs sung in the ""work"" context are associated with the linguistic variation, whereas no association is found between the musical and genetic variation."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Despite remarkable progress in digital linguistics, extensive databases of geographical language distributions are missing. This hampers both studies on language spatiality and public outreach of language diversity. We present best practices for creating and sharing digital spatial language data by collecting and harmonizing Uralic language distributions as case study. Language distribution studies have utilized various methodologies, and the results are often available as printed maps or written descriptions. In order to analyze language spatiality, the information must be digitized into geospatial data, which contains location, time and other parameters. When compiled and harmonized, this data can be used to study changes in languages’ distribution, and combined with, for example, population and environmental data. We also utilized the knowledge of language experts to adjust previous and new information of language distributions into state-of-the-art maps. The extensive database, including the distribution datasets and detailed map visualizations of the Uralic languages are introduced alongside this article, and they are freely available."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"We study the correlation between phylogenetic and geographic distances for the languages of the Andic branch of the East Caucasian (Nakh-Daghestanian) language family. For several alternative phylogenies, we find that geographic distances correlate with linguistic divergence. Notably, qualitative classifications show a better fit with geography than cognacy-based phylogenies. We interpret this result as follows: The better fit may be due to implicit geographic bias in qualitative classifications. We conclude that approaches to classification other than those based on cognacy run a risk to implicitly include geography and geography-related factors as one basis of genealogical classifications."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Linguistic variation in space reflects patterns of social interaction. Gravity models have been successfully used to capture the role of urban centers in the dissemination of innovations in the speech community along with the diffusion of variants in space. Crucially, the effects of the factors of a gravity model (distance and population size) depend on language situation and may result from different sources, in particular processes of vertical and horizontal convergence. In the present study, we investigate lexical variation in contemporary Yucatec Maya, an indigenous language of Mexico, spoken in a situation of generalized bilingualism. This language situation lacks some crucial ingredients of vertical convergence: no variety of Yucatec Maya has the status of a standard variety: the language of administration and education is Spanish (diglossia-with-bilingualism). The present study finds evidence of convergence processes that can be exclusively attributed to horizontal convergence. The lexical distance between speakers decreases in and between urban centers, variants with a large distribution are more likely in areas with a maximum of interactions with other areas. Even Spanish variants are distributed in the sample with a pattern that reveals processes of horizontal convergence: their distribution is accounted for through an areal bias (widespread in areas with a stronger exposition to Spanish) rather by influences from the urban centers (as centers of administration/education) to the rural areas in their surroundings."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"The origins of linguistic diversity remain controversial. Studies disagree on whether group features such as population size or social structure accelerate or decelerate linguistic differentiation. While some analyses of between-group factors highlight the role of geographical isolation and reduced linguistic exchange in differentiation, others suggest that linguistic divergence is driven primarily by warfare among neighbouring groups and the use of language as marker of group identity. Here we provide the first integrated test of the effects of five historical sociodemographic and geographic variables on three measures of linguistic diversification among 50 Austronesian languages: rates of word gain, loss and overall lexical turnover. We control for their shared evolutionary histories through a time-calibrated phylogenetic sister-pairs approach. Results show that languages spoken in larger communities create new words at a faster pace. Within-group conflict promotes linguistic differentiation by increasing word loss, while warfare hinders linguistic differentiation by decreasing both rates of word gain and loss. Finally, we show that geographical isolation is a strong driver of lexical evolution mainly due to a considerable drift-driven acceleration in rates of word loss. We conclude that the motor of extreme linguistic diversity in Austronesia may have been the dispersal of populations across relatively isolated islands, favouring strong cultural ties amongst societies instead of warfare and cultural group marking."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Environmental parameters constrain the distributions of plant and animal species. A key question is to what extent does environment influence human behavior. Decreasing linguistic diversity from the equator towards the poles suggests that ecological factors influence linguistic geography. However, attempts to quantify the role of environmental factors in shaping linguistic diversity remain inconclusive. To this end, we apply Ecological Niche Modelling methods to present-day language diversity in New Guinea. We define an Eco-Linguistic Niche (ELN) as the range of environmental conditions present in the territory of a population speaking a specific language or group of languages characterized by common language traits. In order to reconstruct the ELNs, we used Papuan and Austronesian language groups, transformed their geographical distributions into occurrence data, assembled available environmental data for New Guinea, and applied predictive architectures developed in the field of ecology to these data. We find no clear relationship between linguistic diversity and ELNs. This is particularly true when linguistic diversity is examined at the level of language groups. Language groups are variably dependent on environment and generally share their ELN with other language groups. This variability suggests that population dynamics, migration, linguistic drift, and socio-cultural mechanisms must be taken into consideration in order to better understand the myriad factors that shape language diversity."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"All results in this paper are based upon a new dataset consisting in 60 Swadesh lists of 207 items, overall 12,420 terms collected during 2018-2019. Each list corresponds to a different variety of Malagasy, which is not simply identified by the name of the ethnicity but also by the precise location where the variety was collected. This is very important since some traditional ethnic groups are a heritage of historical events rather than representing communities with similar habits and dialects. This new dataset is by far the best available, both for dimension and completeness. The varieties are classified both by standard tools, as the trees generated by UPGMA and NJ which privilege genealogy by detecting vertical transmissions, and by a new method which privileges horizontal exchanges. The new method results in a two-dimensional chart of Madagascar which realistically reproduces geography despite being generated only by comparison of words. The landing date of the ancestors of Malagasy is determined about 650 CE. This result is obtained by a straightforward approach based on the comparison of the UPGMA Malagasy family tree with the analogous tree of Romance family of languages for which all dates are well historically attested. We also propose an improved definition of Diversity computed for every locus in Madagascar and not only in places where the dialects were collected. Moreover, Diversity becomes a locally determined quantity as it is usually in biology. Diversity differences point to the South-East coast as the location where the first colonizers landed or, at least, where Malagasy variants started their dispersion. Finally, we find that the dialect spoken by the Mikea, a hunter-gatherer people in the South-West of Madagascar, is not very different from the variants of their neighbours Vezo and Masikoro. Therefore, Mikea unlikely can be linked to eventual aboriginal populations living in Madagascar prior to the main colonization event in 650 CE."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Human societies exhibit a diversity of social organizations that vary widely in size, structure, and complexity. Today, human sociopolitical complexity ranges from stateless small-scale societies of a few hundred individuals to complex states of millions, most of this diversity evolving only over the last few hundred years. Understanding how sociopolitical complexity evolved over time and space has always been a central focus of the social sciences. Yet despite this long-term interest, a quantitative understanding of how sociopolitical complexity varies across cultures is not well developed. Here we use scaling analysis to examine the statistical structure of a global sample of over a thousand human societies across multiple levels of sociopolitical complexity. First, we show that levels of sociopolitical complexity are self-similar as adjacent levels of jurisdictional hierarchy see a four-fold increase in population size, a two-fold increase in geographic range, and therefore a doubling of population density. Second, we show how this self-similarity leads to the scaling of population size and geographic range. As societies increase in complexity population density is reconfigured in space and quantified by scaling parameters. However, there is considerable overlap in population metrics across all scales suggesting that while more complex societies tend to have larger and denser populations, larger and denser populations are not necessarily more complex."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Like the transfer of genetic variation through gene flow, language changes constantly as a result of its use in human interaction. Contact between speakers is most likely to happen when they are close in space, time, and social setting. Here, we investigated the role of geographical configuration in this process by studying linguistic diversity in Japan, which comprises a large connected mainland (less isolation, more potential contact) and smaller island clusters of the Ryukyuan archipelago (more isolation, less potential contact). We quantified linguistic diversity using dialectometric methods, and performed regression analyses to assess the extent to which distance in space and time predict contemporary linguistic diversity. We found that language diversity in general increases as geographic distance increases and as time passes—as with biodiversity. Moreover, we found that (I) for mainland languages, linguistic diversity is most strongly related to geographic distance—a so-called isolation-by-distance pattern, and that (II) for island languages, linguistic diversity reflects the time since varieties separated and diverged—an isolation-by-colonisation pattern. Together, these results confirm previous findings that (linguistic) diversity is shaped by distance, but also goes beyond this by demonstrating the critical role of geographic configuration."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Languages have inherent characteristics that make them their own and differentiated entities within their phyla and families. Even messages written in any language and later encrypted by cryptographic systems do not lose all of their characteristics, there remain aspects that help the cryptanalyst to recover them without knowing the decryption keys. For the characterization of the languages we will consider the frequencies of their graphemic and phonetic units and the Index of Coincidence, tools of fundamental utility in the field of Cryptography. Their diachronic invariance or survival over time in one language and their ability to discriminate against other languages will be analized. In order to do so, we will examine a total of 101 languages of which 261 texts have been taken. All of them are very diverse in style and time, taking us through a wide linguistic and temporal spectrum that will cover the period from the 6th century BC to the present day."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Music listening is an inherently cultural behavior, which may be shaped by users’ backgrounds and contextual characteristics. Due to geographical, socio-economic, linguistic, and cultural factors as well as friendship networks, users in different countries may have different music preferences. Investigating cultural-socio-economic factors that might be associated with between-country differences in music preferences can facilitate music information retrieval, contribute to the prediction of users’ music preferences, and improve music recommendation in cross-country contexts. However, previous literature provides limited empirical evidence of the relationships between possible cross-country differences on a wide range of socio-economic aspects and those in music preferences. To bridge this research gap, and drawing on a large-scale dataset, LFM-1b, this study examines the possible relationship between cross-country differences in artist, album, and genre listening frequencies as well as the cross-country distance in geographical, socio-economic, linguistic, cultural, and friendship connections using the Quadratic Assignment Procedure. Results indicate: (1) there is no significant relationship between geographical and economic distance on album, artist, and genre preferences’ distance at the country-level; (2) the cross-country distance of three cultural dimensions (masculinity, long-term orientation, and indulgence) is positively associated with both the album and artist preferences distances; (3) the between-country distance in main languages has a positive relationship with the album, artist, and genre preferences distances across countries; (4) the density of friendship connections among countries negatively correlates to the cross-country preference distances in terms of artist and genre. Findings from this study not only expand knowledge of factors related to music preferences at the country level, but also can be integrated into real-world music recommendation systems that consider country-level music preferences."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Feature stability, time and tempo of change, and the role of genealogy versus areality in creating linguistic diversity are important issues in current computational research on linguistic typology. This paper presents a database initiative, DiACL Typology, which aims to provide a resource for addressing these questions with specific of the extended Indo-European language area of Eurasia, the region with the best documented linguistic history. The database is pre-prepared for statistical and phylogenetic analyses and contains both linguistic typological data from languages spanning over four millennia, and linguistic metadata concerning geographic location, time period, and reliability of sources. The typological data has been organized according to a hierarchical model of increasing granularity in order to create datasets that are complete and representative."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"In this paper we explore the results of a large-scale online game called ‘the Great Language Game’, in which people listen to an audio speech sample and make a forced-choice guess about the identity of the language from 2 or more alternatives. The data include 15 million guesses from 400 audio recordings of 78 languages. We investigate which languages are confused for which in the game, and if this correlates with the similarities that linguists identify between languages. This includes shared lexical items, similar sound inventories and established historical relationships. Our findings are, as expected, that players are more likely to confuse two languages that are objectively more similar. We also investigate factors that may affect players’ ability to accurately select the target language, such as how many people speak the language, how often the language is mentioned in written materials and the economic power of the target language community. We see that non-linguistic factors affect players’ ability to accurately identify the target. For example, languages with wider ‘global reach’ are more often identified correctly. This suggests that both linguistic and cultural knowledge influence the perception and recognition of languages and their similarity."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"From the foods we eat and the houses we construct, to our religious practices and political organization, to who we can marry and the types of games we teach our children, the diversity of cultural practices in the world is astounding. Yet, our ability to visualize and understand this diversity is limited by the ways it has been documented and shared: on a culture-by-culture basis, in locally-told stories or difficult-to-access repositories. In this paper we introduce D-PLACE, the Database of Places, Language, Culture, and Environment. This expandable and open-access database (accessible at https://d-place.org) brings together a dispersed corpus of information on the geography, language, culture, and environment of over 1400 human societies. We aim to enable researchers to investigate the extent to which patterns in cultural diversity are shaped by different forces, including shared history, demographics, migration/diffusion, cultural innovations, and environmental and ecological conditions. We detail how D-PLACE helps to overcome four common barriers to understanding these forces: i) location of relevant cultural data, (ii) linking data from distinct sources using diverse ethnonyms, (iii) variable time and place foci for data, and (iv) spatial and historical dependencies among cultural groups that present challenges for analysis. D-PLACE facilitates the visualisation of relationships among cultural groups and between people and their environments, with results downloadable as tables, on a map, or on a linguistic tree. We also describe how D-PLACE can be used for exploratory, predictive, and evolutionary analyses of cultural diversity by a range of users, from members of the worldwide public interested in contrasting their own cultural practices with those of other societies, to researchers using large-scale computational phylogenetic analyses to study cultural evolution. In summary, we hope that D-PLACE will enable new lines of investigation into the major drivers of cultural change and global patterns of cultural diversity."

PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Common walnut (Juglans regia L) is an economically important species cultivated worldwide for its wood and nuts. It is generally accepted that J. regia survived and grew spontaneously in almost completely isolated stands in its Asian native range after the Last Glacial Maximum. Despite its natural geographic isolation, J. regia evolved over many centuries under the influence of human management and exploitation. We evaluated the hypothesis that the current distribution of natural genetic resources of common walnut in Asia is, at least in part, the product of ancient anthropogenic dispersal, human cultural interactions, and afforestation. Genetic analysis combined with ethno-linguistic and historical data indicated that ancient trade routes such as the Persian Royal Road and Silk Road enabled long-distance dispersal of J. regia from Iran and Trans-Caucasus to Central Asia, and from Western to Eastern China. Ancient commerce also disrupted the local spatial genetic structure of autochthonous walnut populations between Tashkent and Samarkand (Central-Eastern Uzbekistan), where the northern and central routes of the Northern Silk Road converged. A significant association between ancient language phyla and the genetic structure of walnut populations is reported even after adjustment for geographic distances that could have affected both walnut gene flow and human commerce over the centuries. Beyond the economic importance of common walnut, our study delineates an alternative approach for understanding how the genetic resources of long-lived perennial tree species may be affected by the interaction of geography and human history."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"The Slavic branch of the Balto-Slavic sub-family of Indo-European languages underwent rapid divergence as a result of the spatial expansion of its speakers from Central-East Europe, in early medieval times. This expansion–mainly to East Europe and the northern Balkans–resulted in the incorporation of genetic components from numerous autochthonous populations into the Slavic gene pools. Here, we characterize genetic variation in all extant ethnic groups speaking Balto-Slavic languages by analyzing mitochondrial DNA (n = 6,876), Y-chromosomes (n = 6,079) and genome-wide SNP profiles (n = 296), within the context of other European populations. We also reassess the phylogeny of Slavic languages within the Balto-Slavic branch of Indo-European. We find that genetic distances among Balto-Slavic populations, based on autosomal and Y-chromosomal loci, show a high correlation (0.9) both with each other and with geography, but a slightly lower correlation (0.7) with mitochondrial DNA and linguistic affiliation. The data suggest that genetic diversity of the present-day Slavs was predominantly shaped in situ, and we detect two different substrata: ‘central-east European’ for West and East Slavs, and ‘south-east European’ for South Slavs. A pattern of distribution of segments identical by descent between groups of East-West and South Slavs suggests shared ancestry or a modest gene flow between those two groups, which might derive from the historic spread of Slavic people."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Male homosexual preference (MHP) has long been of interest to scholars studying the evolution of human sexuality. Indeed, MHP is partially heritable, induces a reproductive cost and is common. MHP has thus been considered a Darwinian paradox. Several questions arise when MHP is considered in an evolutionary context. At what point did MHP appear in the human evolutionary history? Is MHP present in all human groups? How has MHP evolved, given that MHP is a reproductively costly trait? These questions were addressed here, using data from the anthropological and archaeological literature. Our detailed analysis of the available data challenges the common view of MHP being a “virtually universal” trait present in humans since prehistory. The conditions under which it is possible to affirm that MHP was present in past societies are discussed. Furthermore, using anthropological reports, the presence or absence of MHP was documented for 107 societies, allowing us to conclude that evidence of the absence of MHP is available for some societies. A recent evolutionary hypothesis has argued that social stratification together with hypergyny (the hypergyny hypothesis) are necessary conditions for the evolution of MHP. Here, the link between the level of stratification and the probability of observing MHP was tested using an unprecedented large dataset. Furthermore, the test was performed for the first time by controlling for the phylogenetic non-independence between societies. A positive relationship was observed between the level of social stratification and the probability of observing MHP, supporting the hypergyny hypothesis."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Six decades ago the DI*A allele of the Diego blood group system was instrumental in proving Native American populations originated from Siberia. Since then, it has received scant attention. The present study was undertaken to reappraise distribution of the DI*A allele in 144 Native American populations based on current knowledge. Using analysis of variance tests, frequency distribution was studied according to geographical, environmental, and cultural parameters. Frequencies were highest in Amazonian populations. In contrast, DI*A was undetectable in subarctic, Fuegian, Panamanian, Chaco and Yanomama populations. Closer study revealed a correlation that this unequal distribution was correlated with language, suggesting that linguistic divergence was a driving force in the expansion of DI*A among Native Americans. The absence of DI*A in circumpolar Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dene speakers was consistent with a late migratory event confined to North America. Distribution of DI*A in subtropical areas indicated that gene and culture exchanges were more intense within than between ecozones. Bolstering the utility of classical genetic markers in biological anthropology, the present study of the expansion of Diego blood group genetic polymorphism in Native Americans shows strong evidence of gene-culture comigration."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"To assess whether the present-day geographical variability of Spanish surnames mirrors historical phenomena occurred at the times of their introduction (13th-16th century), and to infer the possible effect of foreign immigration (about 11% of present-day) on the observed patterns of diversity, we have analyzed the frequency distribution of 33,753 unique surnames (tokens) occurring 51,419,788 times, according to the list of Spanish residents of the year 2008. Isonymy measures and surname distances have been computed for, and between, the 47 mainland Spanish provinces and compared to a numerical classification of corresponding language varieties spoken in Spain. The comparison of the two bootstrap consensus trees, representing surname and linguistic variability, suggests a similar picture; major clusters are located in the east (Aragón, Cataluña, Valencia), and in the north of the country (Asturias, Galicia, León). Remaining regions appear to be considerably homogeneous. We interpret this pattern as the long-lasting effect of the surname and linguistic normalization actively led by the Christian kingdoms of the north (Reigns of Castilla y León and Aragón) during and after the southwards reconquest (Reconquista) of the territories ruled by the Arabs from the 8th century to the late 15th century, that is when surnames became transmitted in a fixed way and when Castilian linguistic varieties became increasingly prestigious and spread out. The geography of contemporary surname and linguistic variability in Spain corresponds to the political geography at the end of the Middle-Ages. The synchronicity between surname adoption and the political and cultural effects of the Reconquista have permanently forged a Spanish identity that subsequent migrations, internal or external, did not deface."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Computer-mediated communication is driving fundamental changes in the nature of written language. We investigate these changes by statistical analysis of a dataset comprising 107 million Twitter messages (authored by 2.7 million unique user accounts). Using a latent vector autoregressive model to aggregate across thousands of words, we identify high-level patterns in diffusion of linguistic change over the United States. Our model is robust to unpredictable changes in Twitter's sampling rate, and provides a probabilistic characterization of the relationship of macro-scale linguistic influence to a set of demographic and geographic predictors. The results of this analysis offer support for prior arguments that focus on geographical proximity and population size. However, demographic similarity – especially with regard to race – plays an even more central role, as cities with similar racial demographics are far more likely to share linguistic influence. Rather than moving towards a single unified “netspeak” dialect, language evolution in computer-mediated communication reproduces existing fault lines in spoken American English."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"We perform a large-scale analysis of language diatopic variation using geotagged microblogging datasets. By collecting all Twitter messages written in Spanish over more than two years, we build a corpus from which a carefully selected list of concepts allows us to characterize Spanish varieties on a global scale. A cluster analysis proves the existence of well defined macroregions sharing common lexical properties. Remarkably enough, we find that Spanish language is split into two superdialects, namely, an urban speech used across major American and Spanish citites and a diverse form that encompasses rural areas and small towns. The latter can be further clustered into smaller varieties with a stronger regional character."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Culture is a phenomenon shared by all humans. Attempts to understand how dynamic factors affect the origin and distribution of cultural elements are, therefore, of interest to all humanity. As case studies go, understanding the distribution of cultural elements in Native American communities during the historical period of the Great Plains would seem a most challenging one. Famously, there is a mixture of powerful internal and external factors, creating-for a relatively brief period in time-a seemingly distinctive set of shared elements from a linguistically diverse set of peoples. This is known across the world as the “Great Plains culture.” Here, quantitative analyses show how different processes operated on two sets of cultural traits among nine High Plains groups. Moccasin decorations exhibit a pattern consistent with geographically-mediated between-group interaction. However, group variations in the religious ceremony of the Sun Dance also reveal evidence of purifying cultural selection associated with historical biases, dividing down ancient linguistic lines. The latter shows that while the conglomeration of “Plains culture” may have been a product of merging new ideas with old, combined with cultural interchange between groups, the details of what was accepted, rejected or elaborated in each case reflected preexisting ideological biases. Although culture may sometimes be a “melting pot,” the analyses show that even in highly fluid situations, cultural mosaics may be indirectly shaped by historical factors that are not always obvious."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Evidence from a number of countries in Europe and North America point towards the secular declining trend in menarcheal age with considerable spatial variations over the past two centuries. Similar trends were reported in several developing countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America. However, data corroborating any secular trend in the menarcheal age of the Indian population remained sparse and inadequately verified."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"One of the most well studied ecological patterns is Rapoport's rule, which posits that the geographical extent of species ranges increases at higher latitudes. However, studies to date have been limited in their geographic scope and results have been equivocal. In turn, much debate exists over potential links between Rapoport's rule and latitudinal patterns in species richness. Humans collectively speak nearly 7000 different languages, which are spread unevenly across the globe, with loci in the tropics. Causes of this skewed distribution have received only limited study. We analyze the extent of Rapoport's rule in human languages at a global scale and within each region of the globe separately. We test the relationship between Rapoport's rule and the richness of languages spoken in different regions. We also explore the frequency distribution of language-range sizes. The language-range area distribution is strongly right-skewed, with 87% of languages having range areas less than 10,000 km2, and only nine languages with range areas over 1,000,000 km2. At a global scale, language-range extents and areas are positively correlated with latitude. At a global scale and in five of the six regions examined, language-range extent and language-range area are strongly correlated with language richness. Our results point to group boundary formation as a critical mediator of the relationship between Rapoport's rule and diversity patterns. Where strong group boundaries limit range overlap, as is the case with human languages, and range sizes increase with latitude, latitudinal richness gradients may result."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"We consider the conditions of peace and violence among ethnic groups, testing a theory designed to predict the locations of violence and interventions that can promote peace. Characterizing the model's success in predicting peace requires examples where peace prevails despite diversity. Switzerland is recognized as a country of peace, stability and prosperity. This is surprising because of its linguistic and religious diversity that in other parts of the world lead to conflict and violence. Here we analyze how peaceful stability is maintained. Our analysis shows that peace does not depend on integrated coexistence, but rather on well defined topographical and political boundaries separating groups, allowing for partial autonomy within a single country. In Switzerland, mountains and lakes are an important part of the boundaries between sharply defined linguistic areas. Political canton and circle (sub-canton) boundaries often separate religious groups. Where such boundaries do not appear to be sufficient, we find that specific aspects of the population distribution guarantee either sufficient separation or sufficient mixing to inhibit intergroup violence according to the quantitative theory of conflict. In exactly one region, a porous mountain range does not adequately separate linguistic groups and that region has experienced significant violent conflict, leading to the recent creation of the canton of Jura. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that violence between groups can be inhibited by physical and political boundaries. A similar analysis of the area of the former Yugoslavia shows that during widespread ethnic violence existing political boundaries did not coincide with the boundaries of distinct groups, but peace prevailed in specific areas where they did coincide. The success of peace in Switzerland may serve as a model to resolve conflict in other ethnically diverse countries and regions of the world."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"There are several indigenous ethnic populations along the silk road in the Northwest of China that display clear differences in culture and social customs, perhaps as a result of geographic isolation and different linguistic traditions. However, extensive trade and other interactions probably facilitated the admixture of different gene pools between these populations over the last two millennia. To further explore the evolutionary relationships of the 13 ethnic populations residing in Northwest China and to reveal the features of population admixture, the 9 most-commonly employed CODIS loci (D3S1358, TH01, D5S818, D13S317, D7S820, CSF1PO, vWA, TPOX, FGA) were selected for genotyping and further analysis. Phylogenetic tree and principal component analysis revealed clear pattern of population differentiation between 4 populations living in Sinkiang Uighur Autonomous Region and other 9 populations dwelled in the upper regions of Silk Road. R matrix regression showed high-level gene flow and population admixture dose exist among these ethic populations in the Northwest region of China. Furthermore, the Mantel test suggests that larger percent of genetic variance (21.58% versus 2.3%) can be explained by geographic isolation than linguistic barriers, which matched with the contribution of geographic factors to other world populations."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"The greater Himalayan region demarcates two of the most prominent linguistic phyla in Asia: Tibeto-Burman and Indo-European. Previous genetic surveys, mainly using Y-chromosome polymorphisms and/or mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms suggested a substantially reduced geneflow between populations belonging to these two phyla. These studies, however, have mainly focussed on populations residing far to the north and/or south of this mountain range, and have not been able to study geneflow patterns within the greater Himalayan region itself. We now report a detailed, linguistically informed, genetic survey of Tibeto-Burman and Indo-European speakers from the Himalayan countries Nepal and Bhutan based on autosomal microsatellite markers and compare these populations with surrounding regions. The genetic differentiation between populations within the Himalayas seems to be much higher than between populations in the neighbouring countries. We also observe a remarkable genetic differentiation between the Tibeto-Burman speaking populations on the one hand and Indo-European speaking populations on the other, suggesting that language and geography have played an equally large role in defining the genetic composition of present-day populations within the Himalayas."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Evenks and Evens, Tungusic-speaking reindeer herders and hunter-gatherers, are spread over a wide area of northern Asia, whereas their linguistic relatives the Udegey, sedentary fishermen and hunter-gatherers, are settled to the south of the lower Amur River. The prehistory and relationships of these Tungusic peoples are as yet poorly investigated, especially with respect to their interactions with neighbouring populations. In this study, we analyse over 500 complete mtDNA genome sequences from nine different Evenk and even subgroups as well as their geographic neighbours from Siberia and their linguistic relatives the Udegey from the Amur-Ussuri region in order to investigate the prehistory of the Tungusic populations. These data are supplemented with analyses of Y-chromosomal haplogroups and STR haplotypes in the Evenks, Evens, and neighbouring Siberian populations. We demonstrate that whereas the North Tungusic Evenks and Evens show evidence of shared ancestry both in the maternal and in the paternal line, this signal has been attenuated by genetic drift and differential gene flow with neighbouring populations, with isolation by distance further shaping the maternal genepool of the Evens. The Udegey, in contrast, appear quite divergent from their linguistic relatives in the maternal line, with a mtDNA haplogroup composition characteristic of populations of the Amur-Ussuri region. Nevertheless, they show affinities with the Evenks, indicating that they might be the result of admixture between local Amur-Ussuri populations and Tungusic populations from the north."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"We present evidence that the geographic context in which a language is spoken may directly impact its phonological form. We examined the geographic coordinates and elevations of 567 language locations represented in a worldwide phonetic database. Languages with phonemic ejective consonants were found to occur closer to inhabitable regions of high elevation, when contrasted to languages without this class of sounds. In addition, the mean and median elevations of the locations of languages with ejectives were found to be comparatively high. The patterns uncovered surface on all major world landmasses, and are not the result of the influence of particular language families. They reflect a significant and positive worldwide correlation between elevation and the likelihood that a language employs ejective phonemes. In addition to documenting this correlation in detail, we offer two plausible motivations for its existence. We suggest that ejective sounds might be facilitated at higher elevations due to the associated decrease in ambient air pressure, which reduces the physiological effort required for the compression of air in the pharyngeal cavity–a unique articulatory component of ejective sounds. In addition, we hypothesize that ejective sounds may help to mitigate rates of water vapor loss through exhaled air. These explications demonstrate how a reduction of ambient air density could promote the usage of ejective phonemes in a given language. Our results reveal the direct influence of a geographic factor on the basic sound inventories of human languages."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Large scale analysis and statistics of socio-technical systems that just a few short years ago would have required the use of consistent economic and human resources can nowadays be conveniently performed by mining the enormous amount of digital data produced by human activities. Although a characterization of several aspects of our societies is emerging from the data revolution, a number of questions concerning the reliability and the biases inherent to the big data “proxies” of social life are still open. Here, we survey worldwide linguistic indicators and trends through the analysis of a large-scale dataset of microblogging posts. We show that available data allow for the study of language geography at scales ranging from country-level aggregation to specific city neighborhoods. The high resolution and coverage of the data allows us to investigate different indicators such as the linguistic homogeneity of different countries, the touristic seasonal patterns within countries and the geographical distribution of different languages in multilingual regions. This work highlights the potential of geolocalized studies of open data sources to improve current analysis and develop indicators for major social phenomena in specific communities."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"The identification of isolation signatures is fundamental to better understand the genetic structure of human populations and to test the relations between cultural factors and genetic variation. However, with current approaches, it is not possible to distinguish between the consequences of long-term isolation and the effects of reduced sample size, selection and differential gene flow. To overcome these limitations, we have integrated the analysis of classical genetic diversity measures with a Bayesian method to estimate gene flow and have carried out simulations based on the coalescent. Combining these approaches, we first tested whether the relatively short history of cultural and geographical isolation of four “linguistic islands” of the Eastern Alps (Lessinia, Sauris, Sappada and Timau) had left detectable signatures in their genetic structure. We then compared our findings to previous studies of European population isolates. Finally, we explored the importance of demographic and cultural factors in shaping genetic diversity among the groups under study. A combination of small initial effective size and continued genetic isolation from surrounding populations seems to provide a coherent explanation for the diversity observed among Sauris, Sappada and Timau, which was found to be substantially greater than in other groups of European isolated populations. Simulations of micro-evolutionary scenarios indicate that ethnicity might have been important in increasing genetic diversity among these culturally related and spatially close populations."

PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Language is the best example of a cultural evolutionary system, able to retain a phylogenetic signal over many thousands of years. The temporal stability (conservatism) of basic vocabulary is relatively well understood, but the stability of the structural properties of language (phonology, morphology, syntax) is still unclear. Here we report an extensive Bayesian phylogenetic investigation of the structural stability of numerous features across many language families and we introduce a novel method for analyzing the relationships between the “stability profiles” of language families. We found that there is a strong universal component across language families, suggesting the existence of universal linguistic, cognitive and genetic constraints. Against this background, however, each language family has a distinct stability profile, and these profiles cluster by geographic area and likely deep genealogical relationships. These stability profiles seem to show, for example, the ancient historical relationships between the Siberian and American language families, presumed to be separated by at least 12,000 years, and possible connections between the Eurasian families. We also found preliminary support for the punctuated evolution of structural features of language across families, types of features and geographic areas. Thus, such higher-level properties of language seen as an evolutionary system might allow the investigation of ancient connections between languages and shed light on the peopling of the world."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"This study aims at investigating the HLA molecular variation across Switzerland in order to determine possible regional differences, which would be highly relevant to several purposes: optimizing donor recruitment strategies in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), providing reliable reference data in HLA and disease association studies, and understanding the population genetic background(s) of this culturally heterogeneous country. HLA molecular data of more than 20,000 HSCT donors from 9–13 recruitment centers of the whole country were analyzed. Allele and haplotype frequencies were estimated by using new computer tools adapted to the heterogeneity and ambiguity of the data. Non-parametric and resampling statistical tests were performed to assess Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, selective neutrality and linkage disequilibrium among different loci, both in each recruitment center and in the whole national registry. Genetic variation was explored through genetic distance and hierarchical analysis of variance taking into account both geographic and linguistic subdivisions in Switzerland. The results indicate a heterogeneous genetic makeup of the Swiss population: first, allele frequencies estimated on the whole national registry strongly deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, by contrast with the results obtained for individual centers; second, a pronounced differentiation is observed for Ticino, Graubünden, and, to a lesser extent, Wallis, suggesting that the Alps represent(ed) a barrier to gene flow; finally, although cultural (linguistic) boundaries do not represent a main genetic differentiation factor in Switzerland, the genetic relatedness between population from south-eastern Switzerland and Italy agrees with historical and linguistic data. Overall, this study justifies the maintenance of a decentralized donor recruitment structure in Switzerland allowing increasing the genetic diversity of the national—and hence global—donor registry. It also indicates that HLA data of local donor recruitment centers can be used as reference data in both epidemiological and population genetic studies focusing on the genetic history of present European populations."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"The dialects of Madagascar belong to the Greater Barito East group of the Austronesian family and it is widely accepted that the Island was colonized by Indonesian sailors after a maritime trek that probably took place around 650 CE. The language most closely related to Malagasy dialects is Maanyan, but Malay is also strongly related especially for navigation terms. Since the Maanyan Dayaks live along the Barito river in Kalimantan (Borneo) and they do not possess the necessary skill for long maritime navigation, they were probably brought as subordinates by Malay sailors. In a recent paper we compared 23 different Malagasy dialects in order to determine the time and the landing area of the first colonization. In this research we use new data and new methods to confirm that the landing took place on the south-east coast of the Island. Furthermore, we are able to state here that colonization probably consisted of a single founding event rather than multiple settlements.To reach our goal we find out the internal kinship relations among all the 23 Malagasy dialects and we also find out the relations of the 23 dialects to Malay and Maanyan. The method used is an automated version of the lexicostatistic approach. The data from Madagascar were collected by the author at the beginning of 2010 and consist of Swadesh lists of 200 items for 23 dialects covering all areas of the Island. The lists for Maanyan and Malay were obtained from a published dataset integrated with the author's interviews."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Personal naming practices exist in all human groups and are far from random. Rather, they continue to reflect social norms and ethno-cultural customs that have developed over generations. As a consequence, contemporary name frequency distributions retain distinct geographic, social and ethno-cultural patterning that can be exploited to understand population structure in human biology, public health and social science. Previous attempts to detect and delineate such structure in large populations have entailed extensive empirical analysis of naming conventions in different parts of the world without seeking any general or automated methods of population classification by ethno-cultural origin. Here we show how ‘naming networks’, constructed from forename-surname pairs of a large sample of the contemporary human population in 17 countries, provide a valuable representation of cultural, ethnic and linguistic population structure around the world. This innovative approach enriches and adds value to automated population classification through conventional national data sources such as telephone directories and electoral registers. The method identifies clear social and ethno-cultural clusters in such naming networks that extend far beyond the geographic areas in which particular names originated, and that are preserved even after international migration. Moreover, one of the most striking findings of this approach is that these clusters simply ‘emerge’ from the aggregation of millions of individual decisions on parental naming practices for their children, without any prior knowledge introduced by the researcher. Our probabilistic approach to community assignment, both at city level as well as at a global scale, helps to reveal the degree of isolation, integration or overlap between human populations in our rapidly globalising world. As such, this work has important implications for research in population genetics, public health, and social science adding new understandings of migration, identity, integration and social interaction across the world."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"In this study we examine linguistic variation and its dependence on both social and geographic factors. We follow dialectometry in applying a quantitative methodology and focusing on dialect distances, and social dialectology in the choice of factors we examine in building a model to predict word pronunciation distances from the standard Dutch language to 424 Dutch dialects. We combine linear mixed-effects regression modeling with generalized additive modeling to predict the pronunciation distance of 559 words. Although geographical position is the dominant predictor, several other factors emerged as significant. The model predicts a greater distance from the standard for smaller communities, for communities with a higher average age, for nouns (as contrasted with verbs and adjectives), for more frequent words, and for words with relatively many vowels. The impact of the demographic variables, however, varied from word to word. For a majority of words, larger, richer and younger communities are moving towards the standard. For a smaller minority of words, larger, richer and younger communities emerge as driving a change away from the standard. Similarly, the strength of the effects of word frequency and word category varied geographically. The peripheral areas of the Netherlands showed a greater distance from the standard for nouns (as opposed to verbs and adjectives) as well as for high-frequency words, compared to the more central areas. Our findings indicate that changes in pronunciation have been spreading (in particular for low-frequency words) from the Hollandic center of economic power to the peripheral areas of the country, meeting resistance that is stronger wherever, for well-documented historical reasons, the political influence of Holland was reduced. Our results are also consistent with the theory of lexical diffusion, in that distances from the Hollandic norm vary systematically and predictably on a word by word basis."

PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),"Population migrations in Southwest and South China have played an important role in the formation of East Asian populations and led to a high degree of cultural diversity among ethnic minorities living in these areas. To explore the genetic relationships of these ethnic minorities, we systematically surveyed the variation of 10 autosomal STR markers of 1,538 individuals from 30 populations of 25 ethnic minorities, of which the majority were chosen from Southwest China, especially Yunnan Province. With genotyped data of the markers, we constructed phylogenies of these populations with both DA and DC measures and performed a principal component analysis, as well as a clustering analysis by structure. Results showed that we successfully recovered the genetic structure of analyzed populations formed by historical migrations. Aggregation patterns of these populations accord well with their linguistic affiliations, suggesting that deciphering of genetic relationships does in fact offer clues for study of ethnic differentiation."
PLOS ONE (Linguistic Geography),Languages differ greatly both in their syntactic and morphological systems and in the social environments in which they exist. We challenge the view that language grammars are unrelated to social environments in which they are learned and used.
